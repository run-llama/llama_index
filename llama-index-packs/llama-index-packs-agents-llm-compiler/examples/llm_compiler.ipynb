Observation: Miami is the largest city in South Florida and the second-largest in Florida, with a population of 442,241 as of the 2020 census. The city is part of the Miami metropolitan area, which has over 6 million residents. Miami's population is diverse, with a significant Hispanic majority. In 2010, 34.4% of city residents were of Cuban origin, and 15.8% had a Central American background. The Non-Hispanic White population of Miami has been growing, making up 14.0% of the population in 2020. The Non-Hispanic Black population has been declining, making up 11.7% of the population in 2020. Other ethnic groups include those of Asian ancestry, who accounted for 1.0% of Miami's population in 2010. Christianity is the most-practiced religion in Miami, followed by Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, and other religions. As of 2022, there were 3,440 homeless people in Miami-Dade County, with 591 unsheltered homeless people on the streets of Miami.\n",
      "\u001b[0m\u001b[1;3;34mRan task: vector_tool_Chicago. Observation: Chicago has a diverse demographic makeup. The city experienced rapid growth in its early years, with the population reaching over 1 million by 1890. By the end of the 19th century, Chicago was the fifth-largest city in the world. The city saw waves of immigrants from various parts of the world, including Ireland, Southern, Central and Eastern Europe, and Africa. The city's black population doubled between 1910 and 1920, and again between 1920 and 1930. As of July 2019, the largest racial or ethnic group in Chicago is non-Hispanic White at 32.8% of the population, followed by Blacks at 30.1% and the Hispanic population at 29.0%. The city also has the third-largest LGBT population in the United States. The city's population declined in the latter half of the 20th century, but has seen a rise in the 2000 and 2020 censuses.\n",

Extreme cold temperatures, below about 15 °F or -9 °C, are rare due to the moderating influence of the adjacent Puget Sound, the greater Pacific Ocean, and Lake Washington. The city is often cloudy due to frequent storms and lows moving in from the Pacific Ocean, and it has many \"rain days\". However, the rainfall is often a light drizzle.\n",
      "\u001b[0m\u001b[1;3;34mRan task: vector_tool_Chicago. Observation: During wintertime, the city experiences relatively cold and snowy conditions. Blizzards can occur, as they did in winter 2011. The normal winter high from December through March is about 36 °F (2 °C). January and February are the coldest months. A polar vortex in January 2019 nearly broke the city's cold record of −27 °F (−33 °C), which was set on January 20, 1985. Measurable snowfall can continue through the first or second week of April. The city's proximity to Lake Michigan tends to keep the lakefront somewhat cooler in summer and less brutally cold in winter than inland parts of the city and suburbs away from the lake. Northeast winds from wintertime cyclones departing south of the region sometimes bring the city lake-effect snow.\n",
