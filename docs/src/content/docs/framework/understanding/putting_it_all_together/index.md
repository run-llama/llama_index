title: Putting It All Together
---

Congratulations! You've loaded your data, indexed it, stored your index, and queried your index. Now you've got to ship something to production. We can show you how to do that!

- In [Q&A Patterns](/python/framework/understanding/putting_it_all_together/q_and_a) we'll go into some of the more advanced and subtle ways you can build a query engine beyond the basics.
  - The [terms definition tutorial](/python/framework/understanding/putting_it_all_together/q_and_a/terms_definitions_tutorial) is a detailed, step-by-step tutorial on creating a subtle query application including defining your prompts and supporting images as input.
  - We have a guide to [creating a unified query framework over your indexes](/python/examples/retrievers/reciprocal_rerank_fusion) which shows you how to run queries across multiple indexes.
  - And also over [structured data like SQL](/python/framework/understanding/putting_it_all_together/structured_data)
- We have a guide on [how to build a chatbot](/python/framework/understanding/putting_it_all_together/chatbots/building_a_chatbot)
- We talk about [building agents in LlamaIndex](/python/framework/understanding/putting_it_all_together/agents)
- We have a complete guide to using [property graphs for indexing and retrieval](/python/framework/module_guides/indexing/lpg_index_guide)
- And last but not least we show you how to build [a full stack web application](/python/framework/understanding/putting_it_all_together/apps) using LlamaIndex

LlamaIndex also provides some tools / project templates to help you build a full-stack template. For instance, [`create-llama`](https://github.com/run-llama/LlamaIndexTS/tree/main/packages/create-llama) spins up a full-stack scaffold for you.

Check out our [Full-Stack Projects](/python/framework/community/full_stack_projects) page for more details.

We also have the [`llamaindex-cli rag` CLI tool](/python/framework/getting_started/starter_tools/rag_cli) that combines some of the above concepts into an easy to use tool for chatting with files from your terminal!
