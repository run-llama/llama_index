title: Full-Stack Web Application
---

LlamaIndex can be integrated into a downstream full-stack web application. It can be used in a backend server (such as Flask), packaged into a Docker container, and/or directly used in a framework such as Streamlit or CopilotKit.

We provide tutorials and resources to help you get started in this area:

- **[Fullstack Application Guide](/python/framework/understanding/putting_it_all_together/apps/fullstack_app_guide)** shows you how to build an app with LlamaIndex as an API and a TypeScript+React frontend
- **[Fullstack Application with Delphic](/python/framework/understanding/putting_it_all_together/apps/fullstack_with_delphic)** walks you through using LlamaIndex with a production-ready web app starter template called Delphic.
- The **[LlamaIndex Starter Pack](https://github.com/logan-markewich/llama_index_starter_pack)** provides very basic flask, Streamlit, and Docker examples for LlamaIndex.
- **CopilotKit + LlamaIndex:** CopilotKit is the Agentic Application Framework, an open source framework and hosted service for AI-assisted applications.
  - [CopilotKit LlamaIndex Quickstart](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/llamaindex/quickstart): A guide for how to turn your LlamaIndex Agents into an agent-native application in 10 minutes.
  - [CopilotKit <> LlamaIndex Starter](https://github.com/CopilotKit/with-llamaindex): This is a starter template for building AI agents using LlamaIndex and CopilotKit. It provides a modern Next.js application with an integrated investment analyst agent that can research stocks, analyze market data, and provide investment insights.
