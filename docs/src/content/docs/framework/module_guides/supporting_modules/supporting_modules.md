title: Supporting Modules
---

We have two configuration modules that can be configured separately and passed to individual indexes, or set globally.

- The [Settings](/python/framework/module_guides/supporting_modules/settings) includes the LLM you're using, the embedding model, your node parser, your callback manager and more.
- The `StorageContext` lets you specify where and how to store your documents, your vector embeddings, and your indexes. To learn more, read about [customizing storage](/python/framework/module_guides/storing/customization)
