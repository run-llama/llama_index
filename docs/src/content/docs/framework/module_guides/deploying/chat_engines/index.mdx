title: Chat Engine
---

## Concept

Chat engine is a high-level interface for having a conversation with your data
(multiple back-and-forth instead of a single question & answer).
Think ChatGPT, but augmented with your knowledge base.

Conceptually, it is a **stateful** analogy of a [Query Engine](/python/framework/module_guides/deploying/query_engine).
By keeping track of the conversation history, it can answer questions with past context in mind.

<Aside type="tip">
  If you want to ask standalone question over your data (i.e. without keeping
  track of conversation history), use [Query
  Engine](/python/framework/module_guides/deploying/query_engine) instead.

## Usage Pattern

Get started with:

```python
chat_engine = index.as_chat_engine()
response = chat_engine.chat("Tell me a joke.")
```

To stream response:

```python
chat_engine = index.as_chat_engine()
streaming_response = chat_engine.stream_chat("Tell me a joke.")
for token in streaming_response.response_gen:
    print(token, end="")
```
