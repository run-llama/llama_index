# Q&A patterns

## Semantic Search

The most basic example usage of LlamaIndex is through semantic search. We provide a simple in-memory vector store for you to get started, but you can also choose to use any one of our [vector store integrations](../../community/integrations/vector_stores.md):

```python
from llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex, SimpleDirectoryReader

documents = SimpleDirectoryReader("data").load_data()
index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents)
query_engine = index.as_query_engine()
response = query_engine.query("What did the author do growing up?")
print(response)
```

## Summarization

A summarization query requires the LLM to iterate through many if not most documents in order to synthesize an answer.
For instance, a summarization query could look like one of the following:

- "What is a summary of this collection of text?"
- "Give me a summary of person X's experience with the company."

In general, a summary index would be suited for this use case. A summary index by default goes through all the data.

Empirically, setting `response_mode="tree_summarize"` also leads to better summarization results.

```python
index = SummaryIndex.from_documents(documents)

query_engine = index.as_query_engine(response_mode="tree_summarize")
response = query_engine.query("<summarization_query>")
```

## Queries over Structured Data

LlamaIndex supports queries over structured data, whether that's a Pandas DataFrame or a SQL Database.

Here are some relevant resources:

- [Pandas Demo](../../examples/query_engine/pandas_query_engine.ipynb) ([Notebook](https://github.com/jerryjliu/llama_index/blob/main/docs../../examples/query_engine/pandas_query_engine.ipynb))

## Routing over Heterogeneous Data

LlamaIndex also supports routing over heterogeneous data sources with `RouterQueryEngine` - for instance, if you want to "route" a query to an
underlying Document or a sub-index.

To do this, first build the sub-indices over different data sources.
Then construct the corresponding query engines, and give each query engine a description to obtain a `QueryEngineTool`.

```python
from llama_index.core import TreeIndex, VectorStoreIndex
from llama_index.core.tools import QueryEngineTool

...

# define sub-indices
index1 = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(notion_docs)
index2 = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(slack_docs)

# define query engines and tools
tool1 = QueryEngineTool.from_defaults(
    query_engine=index1.as_query_engine(),
    description="Use this query engine to do...",
)
tool2 = QueryEngineTool.from_defaults(
    query_engine=index2.as_query_engine(),
    description="Use this query engine for something else...",
)
```

Then, we define a `RouterQueryEngine` over them.
By default, this uses a `LLMSingleSelector` as the router, which uses the LLM to choose the best sub-index to router the query to, given the descriptions.

```python
from llama_index.core.query_engine import RouterQueryEngine

query_engine = RouterQueryEngine.from_defaults(
    query_engine_tools=[tool1, tool2]
)

response = query_engine.query(
    "In Notion, give me a summary of the product roadmap."
)
```

## Compare/Contrast Queries

You can explicitly perform compare/contrast queries with a **query transformation** module within a ComposableGraph.

```python
from llama_index.core.query.query_transform.base import DecomposeQueryTransform

decompose_transform = DecomposeQueryTransform(
    service_context.llm, verbose=True
)
```

This module will help break down a complex query into a simpler one over your existing index structure.

**Guides**

- [Query Transformations](../../../optimizing/advanced_retrieval/query_transformations.md)

You can also rely on the LLM to _infer_ whether to perform compare/contrast queries (see Multi Document Queries below).

## Multi Document Queries

Besides the explicit synthesis/routing flows described above, LlamaIndex can support more general multi-document queries as well.
It can do this through our `SubQuestionQueryEngine` class. Given a query, this query engine will generate a "query plan" containing
sub-queries against sub-documents before synthesizing the final answer.

To do this, first define an index for each document/data source, and wrap it with a `QueryEngineTool` (similar to above):

```python
from llama_index.core.tools import QueryEngineTool

query_engine_tools = [
    QueryEngineTool.from_defaults(
        query_engine=sept_engine,
        name="sept_22",
        description="Provides information about Uber quarterly financials ending September 2022",
    ),
    QueryEngineTool.from_defaults(
        query_engine=june_engine,
        name="june_22",
        description="Provides information about Uber quarterly financials ending June 2022",
    ),
    QueryEngineTool.from_defaults(
        query_engine=march_engine,
        name="march_22",
        description="Provides information about Uber quarterly financials ending March 2022",
    ),
]
```

Then, we define a `SubQuestionQueryEngine` over these tools:

```python
from llama_index.core.query_engine import SubQuestionQueryEngine

query_engine = SubQuestionQueryEngine.from_defaults(
    query_engine_tools=query_engine_tools
)
```

This query engine can execute any number of sub-queries against any subset of query engine tools before synthesizing the final answer.
This makes it especially well-suited for compare/contrast queries across documents as well as queries pertaining to a specific document.

- [10K Analysis (Uber and Lyft)](../../../examples/usecases/10k_sub_question.ipynb)

## Multi-Step Queries

LlamaIndex can also support iterative multi-step queries. Given a complex query, break it down into an initial subquestions,
and sequentially generate subquestions based on returned answers until the final answer is returned.

For instance, given a question "Who was in the first batch of the accelerator program the author started?",
the module will first decompose the query into a simpler initial question "What was the accelerator program the author started?",
query the index, and then ask followup questions.

- [Multi-Step Query Decomposition](../../../examples/query_transformations/HyDEQueryTransformDemo.ipynb)

## Temporal Queries

LlamaIndex can support queries that require an understanding of time. It can do this in two ways:

- Decide whether the query requires utilizing temporal relationships between nodes (prev/next relationships) in order to retrieve additional context to answer the question.
- Sort by recency and filter outdated context.
