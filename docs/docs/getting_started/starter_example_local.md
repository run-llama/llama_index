# Starter Tutorial (Using Local LLMs)

This tutorial will show you how to get started building agents with LlamaIndex. We'll start with a basic example and then show how to add RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) capabilities.


We will use [`BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5`](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5) as our embedding model and `llama3.1 8B` served through `Ollama`.

!!! tip
    Make sure you've followed the [installation](installation.md) steps first.

## Setup

Ollama is a tool to help you get set up with LLMs locally with minimal setup.

Follow the [README](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama) to learn how to install it.

To download the Llama3 model just do `ollama pull llama3.1`.

**NOTE**: You will need a machine with at least ~32GB of RAM.

As explained in our [installation guide](installation.md), `llama-index` is actually a collection of packages. To run Ollama and Huggingface, we will need to install those integrations:

```bash
pip install llama-index-llms-ollama llama-index-embeddings-huggingface
```

The package names spell out the imports, which is very helpful for remembering how to import them or install them!

```python
from llama_index.llms.ollama import Ollama
from llama_index.embeddings.huggingface import HuggingFaceEmbedding
```

More integrations are all listed on [https://llamahub.ai](https://llamahub.ai).

## Basic Agent Example

Let's start with a simple example using an agent that can perform basic multiplication by calling a tool. Create a file called `starter.py`:

```python
import asyncio
from llama_index.core.agent.workflow import FunctionAgent
from llama_index.llms.ollama import Ollama


# Define a simple calculator tool
def multiply(a: float, b: float) -> float:
    """Useful for multiplying two numbers."""
    return a * b


# Create an agent workflow with our calculator tool
agent = FunctionAgent(
    tools=[multiply],
    llm=Ollama(model="llama3.1", request_timeout=360.0),
    system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant that can multiply two numbers.",
)


async def main():
    # Run the agent
    response = await agent.run("What is 1234 * 4567?")
    print(str(response))


# Run the agent
if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

This will output something like: `The answer to 1234 * 4567 is: 5,618,916.`

What happened is:

- The agent was given a question: `What is 1234 * 4567?`
- Under the hood, this question, plus the schema of the tools (name, docstring, and arguments) were passed to the LLM
- The agent selected the `multiply` tool and wrote the arguments to the tool
- The agent received the result from the tool and interpolated it into the final response

!!! tip
    As you can see, we are using `async` python functions. Many LLMs and models support async calls, and using async code is recommended to improve performance of your application. To learn more about async code and python, we recommend this [short section on async + python](./async_python.md).

## Adding Chat History

The `AgentWorkflow` is also able to remember previous messages. This is contained inside the `Context` of the `AgentWorkflow`.

If the `Context` is passed in, the agent will use it to continue the conversation.

```python
from llama_index.core.workflow import Context

# create context
ctx = Context(agent)

# run agent with context
response = await agent.run("My name is Logan", ctx=ctx)
response = await agent.run("What is my name?", ctx=ctx)
```

## Adding RAG Capabilities

Now let's enhance our agent by adding the ability to search through documents. First, let's get some example data using our terminal:

```bash
mkdir data
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/run-llama/llama_index/main/docs/docs/examples/data/paul_graham/paul_graham_essay.txt -O data/paul_graham_essay.txt
```

Your directory structure should look like this now:

<pre>
├── starter.py
└── data
    └── paul_graham_essay.txt
</pre>

Now we can create a tool for searching through documents using LlamaIndex. By default, our `VectorStoreIndex` will use a `text-embedding-ada-002` embeddings from OpenAI to embed and retrieve the text.

Our modified `starter.py` should look like this:

```python
from llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex, SimpleDirectoryReader, Settings
from llama_index.core.agent.workflow import AgentWorkflow
from llama_index.llms.ollama import Ollama
from llama_index.embeddings.huggingface import HuggingFaceEmbedding
import asyncio
import os

# Settings control global defaults
Settings.embed_model = HuggingFaceEmbedding(model_name="BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5")
Settings.llm = Ollama(model="llama3.1", request_timeout=360.0)

# Create a RAG tool using LlamaIndex
documents = SimpleDirectoryReader("data").load_data()
index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(
    documents,
    # we can optionally override the embed_model here
    # embed_model=Settings.embed_model,
)
query_engine = index.as_query_engine(
    # we can optionally override the llm here
    # llm=Settings.llm,
)


def multiply(a: float, b: float) -> float:
    """Useful for multiplying two numbers."""
    return a * b


async def search_documents(query: str) -> str:
    """Useful for answering natural language questions about an personal essay written by Paul Graham."""
    response = await query_engine.aquery(query)
    return str(response)


# Create an enhanced workflow with both tools
agent = AgentWorkflow.from_tools_or_functions(
    [multiply, search_documents],
    llm=Settings.llm,
    system_prompt="""You are a helpful assistant that can perform calculations
    and search through documents to answer questions.""",
)


# Now we can ask questions about the documents or do calculations
async def main():
    response = await agent.run(
        "What did the author do in college? Also, what's 7 * 8?"
    )
    print(response)


# Run the agent
if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

The agent can now seamlessly switch between using the calculator and searching through documents to answer questions.

## Storing the RAG Index

To avoid reprocessing documents every time, you can persist the index to disk:

```python
# Save the index
index.storage_context.persist("storage")

# Later, load the index
from llama_index.core import StorageContext, load_index_from_storage

storage_context = StorageContext.from_defaults(persist_dir="storage")
index = load_index_from_storage(
    storage_context,
    # we can optionally override the embed_model here
    # it's important to use the same embed_model as the one used to build the index
    # embed_model=Settings.embed_model,
)
query_engine = index.as_query_engine(
    # we can optionally override the llm here
    # llm=Settings.llm,
)
```

!!! tip
    If you used a [vector store integration](../module_guides/storing/vector_stores.md) besides the default, chances are you can just reload from the vector store:

    ```python
    index = VectorStoreIndex.from_vector_store(
        vector_store,
        # it's important to use the same embed_model as the one used to build the index
        # embed_model=Settings.embed_model,
    )
    ```

## What's Next?
