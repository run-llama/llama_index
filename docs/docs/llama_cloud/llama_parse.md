# LlamaParse

LlamaParse is the world's first genAI-native document parsing platform - built with LLMs and for LLM use cases.

Your LLM application performance is only as good as your data. The main goal of LlamaParse is to parse and clean your data, ensuring that it's good quality before passing to any downstream LLM use case such as advanced RAG.
