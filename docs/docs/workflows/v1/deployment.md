# Deploying a Workflow

You can deploy a workflow as a multi-agent service with [llama_deploy](../../module_guides/llama_deploy) ([repo](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_deploy)). Each agent service is orchestrated via a control plane and communicates via a message queue. Deploy locally or on Kubernetes.
