# Instrumentation

**NOTE**: The `instrumentation` module (available in llama-index v0.10.20 and later) is
meant to replace the legacy `callbacks` module. During the deprecation period,
the llama-index library supports both modules as a means to instrument your
LLM application. However, at some point after all of the existing integrations
have moved over to the new `instrumentation` module, we will no longer support
`callbacks` module.

The new `instrumentation` module allows for the instrumentation of `llama-index`
applications. In particular, one can handle events and track spans using both
custom logic as well as those offered in the module. Users can also define their
own events and specify where and when in the code logic that they should be emitted.
Listed below are the core classes as well as their brief description of the
`instrumentation` module:

- `Event` — represents a single moment in time that a certain occurrence took place within the execution of the application’s code.
- `EventHandler` — listen to the occurrences of `Event`'s and execute code logic at these moments in time.
- `Span` — represents the execution flow of a particular part in the application’s code and thus contains `Event`'s.
- `SpanHandler` — is responsible for the entering, exiting, and dropping (i.e., early exiting due to error) of `Span`'s.
- `Dispatcher` — emits `Event`'s as well as signals to enter/exit/drop a `Span` to the appropriate handlers.


## Using the Instrumentation Module for Observability

A core use case for instrumentation is observability. Our native instrumentation integrations with third-party partners allow you to get detailed traces across the entire call stack.

Check out our [observability guide](/python/framework/module_guides/observability) for more details on supported partners.


## Usage

Using the new `instrumentation` module involves 3 high-level steps.

1. Define a `dispatcher`
2. (Optional) Define and attach your `EventHandler`'s to `dispatcher`
3. (Optional) Define and attach your `SpanHandler` to `dispatcher`

Doing so, would result in the ability to handle events and obtain spans that have
been transmitted throughout the `llama-index` library and extension packages.

For example, if I wanted to track every LLM call made in the library:

```python
from typing import Dict, List

from llama_index.core.instrumentation.events.llm import (
    LLMChatEndEvent,
    LLMChatStartEvent,
    LLMChatInProgressEvent,
)


class ExampleEventHandler(BaseEventHandler):
    events: List[BaseEvent] = []

    @classmethod
    def class_name(cls) -> str:
        """Class name."""
        return "ExampleEventHandler"

    def handle(self, event: BaseEvent) -> None:
        """Logic for handling event."""
        print("-----------------------")
        # all events have these attributes
        print(event.id_)
        print(event.timestamp)
        print(event.span_id)

        # event specific attributes
        if isinstance(event, LLMChatStartEvent):
            # initial
            print(event.messages)
            print(event.additional_kwargs)
            print(event.model_dict)
        elif isinstance(event, LLMChatInProgressEvent):
            # streaming
            print(event.response.delta)
        elif isinstance(event, LLMChatEndEvent):
            # final response
            print(event.response)

        self.events.append(event)
        print("-----------------------")
```

See the [full guide](/python/examples/instrumentation/instrumentation_observability_rundown) on all events logged in LlamaIndex, or visit the [api reference](/python/framework/api_reference/instrumentation) for more details.

### Defining a custom `EventHandler`

Users can create their own custom handlers by subclassing `BaseEventHandler`
and providing logic to the abstract method `handle()`.

```python
from llama_index.core.instrumentation.event_handlers.base import (
    BaseEventHandler,
)


class MyEventHandler(BaseEventHandler):
    """My custom EventHandler."""

    @classmethod
    def class_name(cls) -> str:
        """Class name."""
        return "MyEventHandler"

    def handle(self, event: BaseEvent, **kwargs) -> Any:
        """Logic for handling event."""
        print(event.class_name())


my_event_handler = MyEventHandler()
```

After defining your handler, you can attach it to the desired dispatcher:

```python
import llama_index.core.instrumentation as instrument

dispatcher = instrument.get_dispatcher(__name__)
dispatcher.add_event_handler(my_event_handler)
```

### Defining a custom `Event`

User can create their own custom events by subclassing `BaseEvent`. The
`BaseEvent` class comes with a `timestamp` as well as an `id_` field. To add more
items to this event payload, simply add them in as new `Fields` (since they are
subclasses of `pydantic.BaseModel`).

```python
from llama_index.core.instrumentation.event.base import BaseEvent


class MyEvent(BaseEvent):
    """My custom Event."""

    new_field_1 = Field(...)
    new_field_2 = Field(...)
```

Once you have your custom event defined, you use a dispatcher to fire the event
at desired instances throughout your application’s code.

```python
import llama_index.core.instrumentation as instrument

dispatcher = instrument.get_dispatcher(__name__)
dispatcher.event(MyEvent(new_field_1=..., new_field_2=...))
```

### Defining a custom `Span`

`Span`’s are like `Event`'s in that they are both structured data classes.
Unlike `Event`'s though, `Span`'s as their name implies, span a duration of time
within the programs execution flow. You can define a custom `Span` to store any
information you would like.

```python
from typing import Any
from llama_index.core.bridge.pydantic import Field


class MyCustomSpan(BaseSpan):
    custom_field_1: Any = Field(...)
    custom_field_2: Any = Field(...)
```

To handle your new Span type, you need to also define your custom `SpanHandler`
by subclassing the `BaseSpanHandler` class. Three abstract methods need to be
defined when subclass this base class, namely: `new_span()`, `prepare_to_exit_span()`,
and `prepare_to_drop_span()`.

```python
import inspect
from typing import Any, Dict, Optional
from llama_index.core.instrumentation.span.base import BaseSpan
from llama_index.core.instrumentation.span_handlers import BaseSpanHandler


class MyCustomSpanHandler(BaseSpanHandler[MyCustomSpan]):
    @classmethod
    def class_name(cls) -> str:
        """Class name."""
        return "MyCustomSpanHandler"

    def new_span(
        self,
        id_: str,
        bound_args: inspect.BoundArguments,
        instance: Optional[Any] = None,
        parent_span_id: Optional[str] = None,
        tags: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None,
        **kwargs: Any,
    ) -> Optional[MyCustomSpan]:
        """Create a span."""
        # logic for creating a new MyCustomSpan
        pass

    def prepare_to_exit_span(
        self,
        id_: str,
        bound_args: inspect.BoundArguments,
        instance: Optional[Any] = None,
        result: Optional[Any] = None,
        **kwargs: Any,
    ) -> Any:
        """Logic for preparing to exit a span."""
        pass

    def prepare_to_drop_span(
        self,
        id_: str,
        bound_args: inspect.BoundArguments,
        instance: Optional[Any] = None,
        err: Optional[BaseException] = None,
        **kwargs: Any,
    ) -> Any:
        """Logic for preparing to drop a span."""
        pass
```

To make use of your new SpanHandler (and associated Span type), you simply need
to add it to your desired dispatcher.

```python
import llama_index.core.instrumentation as instrument
from llama_index.core.instrumentation.span_handler import SimpleSpanHandler

dispatcher = (
    instrument.get_dispatcher()
)  # with no name argument, defaults to root

my_span_handler = MyCustomSpanHandler()
dispatcher.add_span_handler(my_span_handler)
```

### Entering/Exiting a `Span`

To send a signal to `SpanHandler`'s to enter/exit a `Span`, we use the `span_enter()`,
`span_exit()` methods, respectively. There is also `span_drop()` method that could
be used to handle cases where `Span`'s are cut shorter than usual due to errors
within the covered code’s execution.

```python
import llama_index.core.instrumentation as instrument

dispatcher = instrument.get_dispatcher(__name__)


def func():
    dispatcher.span_enter(...)
    try:
        val = ...
    except:
        ...
        dispatcher.span_drop(...)
    else:
        dispatcher.span_exit(...)
        return val


# or, syntactic sugar via decorators


@dispatcher.span
def func():
    ...
```

### Making use of `dispatcher` hierarchy

A similar hierarchy to that seen with the standard Python `logging` library and
its `Logger` class exists for `dispatcher`. Specifically, all `dispatcher`’s
except for the root `dispatcher` has a parent, and when handling events or span’s
can propagate them to its parent as well (this is the default behaviour). This
hierarchical method of handling events and spans allows for defining “global”
event handlers as well as “local” ones.

Consider the project structure defined below. There are 3 `dispatcher`'s: one at
the top-level of the `project` and then two others at the individual sub-modules
`llama1` and `llama2`. With this setup, any `EventHandler`’s attached to the
project root’s `dispatcher` will be be subscribed to all `Event`'s that occur in
the execution of code in `llama1` and `llama2`. On the other hand, `EventHandler`'s
defined in the respective `llama<x>` sub modules will only be subscribed to the
`Event`'s that occur within their respective sub-module execution.

```sh
project
├── __init__.py  # has a dispatcher=instrument.get_dispatcher(__name__)
├── llama1
│   ├── __init__.py  # has a dispatcher=instrument.get_dispatcher(__name__)
│   └── app_query_engine.py
└── llama2
    ├── __init__.py  # has a dispatcher=instrument.get_dispatcher(__name__)
    └── app_query_engine.py
```
