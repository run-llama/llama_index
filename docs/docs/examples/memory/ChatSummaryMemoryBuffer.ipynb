    "# Chat Summary Memory Buffer\n",
    "In this demo, we use the new *ChatSummaryMemoryBuffer* to limit the chat history to a certain token length, and iteratively summarize all messages that do not fit in the memory buffer. This can be useful if you want to limit costs and latency (assuming the summarization prompt uses and generates fewer tokens than including the entire history). The original *ChatMemoryBuffer* gives you the option to truncate the history after a certain number of tokens, which is useful to limit costs and latency, but also removes potentially relevant information from the chat history. The new *ChatSummaryMemoryBuffer* aims to makes this a bit more flexible, so the user has more control over which chat_history is retained."
