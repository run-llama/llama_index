They have a wiry double coat that doesn't shed much, which makes them a good choice for people who prefer a cleaner home or have mild allergies. However, their coat does require regular grooming and trimming to keep it looking its best.

Breeds like Miniature Schnauzers, which are adaptable and relatively low-maintenance in terms of shedding, might be a good fit.\n",
