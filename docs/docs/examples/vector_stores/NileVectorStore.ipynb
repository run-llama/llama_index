    "# Nile Vector Store (Multi-tenant PostgreSQL)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how to use the Postgres based vector store `NileVectorStore` to store and query vector embeddings for multi-tenant RAG applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Nile?\n",
    "\n",
    "Nile is a Postgres database that enables all database operations per tenant including auto-scaling, branching, and backups, with full customer isolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-tenant RAG applications are increasingly popular, since they provide security and privacy while using large language models. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, managing the underlying Postgres database is not straightforward. DB-per-tenant is expensive and complex to manage, while shared-DB has security and privacy concerns, and also limits the scalability and performance of the RAG application. Nile re-engineered Postgres to deliver the best of all worlds - the isolation of DB-per-tenant, at the cost, efficiency and developer experience of a shared-DB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Storing millions of vectors in a shared-DB can be slow and require significant resources to index and query. But if you store 1000 tenants in Nile's virtual tenant databases, each with 1000 vectors, this can be quite managable. Especially since you can place larger tenants on their own compute, while smaller tenants can efficiently share compute resources and auto-scale as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started with Nile\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by signing up for [Nile](https://console.thenile.dev/?utm_campaign=partnerlaunch&utm_source=llamaindex&utm_medium=docs). Once you've signed up for Nile, you'll be promoted to create your first database. Go ahead and do so. You'll be redirected to the \"Query Editor\" page of your new database.\n",
    "\n",
    "From there, click on \"Home\" (top icon on the left menu), click on \"generate credentials\" and copy the resulting connection string. You will need it in a sec.\n",
