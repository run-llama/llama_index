      "assistant: Ahoy there, matey! Gather 'round, you landlubbers, and let ol' One-Eyed Jack spin ye a yarn that'll curl yer barnacles and raise yer timbers! This ain't no tale for the faint of heart, mind ye, it's the true story of the Devil's Kiss, the most beautiful, and most cursed, ruby in all the seven seas!\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I acquired this… knowledge, shall we say, back when I was a mere swab, scrubbing decks for Captain \"Rotten\" Roger Reddington. Rotten Roger, bless his scurvy-infested soul, was obsessed with finding the lost treasure of Bartholomew Blackheart, a pirate so vile, he used to floss with sharks' teeth!\n",
      "\n",
      "For years, Rotten Roger chased whispers and rumors, from the soggy jungles of Tortuga to the frozen fjords of the North. Then, one day, we landed on a forsaken isle, a place called Isle de la Llorona, or Weeping Woman's Isle, for those who can't mangle a good foreign tongue. Locals warned us the island was haunted, cursed by the spirit of a maiden who Blackheart had scorned and left to die.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rotten Roger, being about as superstitious as a sea slug, scoffed. \"Ghosts? Bah! I'll face a Kraken with a spoon before I fear a woman's tears!\" He charged into the jungle, me and the rest of the crew trailing behind like so many sea dogs.\n",
      "\n",
      "We stumbled upon a crumbling temple, covered in vines and reeking of decay. Inside, amidst the cobwebs and bat droppings, we found it! Blackheart's tomb! Rotten Roger let out a whoop that would wake the dead, and started tearing through the sarcophagus.\n",
      "\n",
      "And there it was! Resting on a cushion of faded velvet, the Devil's Kiss. A ruby so red, it looked like it held a drop of hellfire itself. It pulsed with a wicked light, hypnotizing even the most grizzled pirates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rotten Roger grabbed the ruby, cackling like a hyena. That's when the wind started howling, and the ground began to shake. The air grew thick with the scent of brine and sorrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we saw her. The Weeping Woman. A spectral figure, pale as moonlight, with tears that flowed like rivers. She let out a wail that could shatter glass, and pointed a skeletal finger at Rotten Roger.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You dare disturb his rest?\" she shrieked. \"You shall pay the price!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, most of the crew, being the cowardly lot they were, hightailed it back to the ship. But Rotten Roger, blinded by greed, stood his ground. He clutched the Devil's Kiss and roared, \"I ain't afraid of no ghost! This ruby is mine!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That's when the curse truly began. One by one, the crew started to meet unfortunate ends. One swallowed a live lobster whole, another was struck by lightning on a clear day, and a third… well, let's just say he tried to shave his beard with a cutlass and wasn't very good at it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rotten Roger, meanwhile, became increasingly paranoid and erratic. He wouldn't sleep, he barely ate, and he started seeing the Weeping Woman everywhere he looked. He blamed the ruby, but he couldn't bring himself to let it go.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, in a fit of madness, he decided to bury the ruby back on the Isle de la Llorona, hoping to appease the ghost. But as he dug the hole, the Weeping Woman appeared again. She grabbed him, and with a bloodcurdling scream, pulled him into the earth!\n",
      "\n",
      "The next morning, the few remaining crew members, myself included, abandoned the island. We never spoke of the Devil's Kiss again.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, that's the tale, mateys. A cautionary one, indeed. The Devil's Kiss is still out there, buried with Rotten Roger on the Isle de la Llorona. A beautiful, cursed gem that brings nothing but misfortune. Take it from ol' One-Eyed Jack, some treasures are best left buried. Now, who's buying the next round of grog? This old pirate's throat is drier than a desert rat's sock!\n",
