    "This notebook shows how to use Cleanlab's Trustworthy Language Model (TLM) and Trustworthiness score.\n",
    "\n",
    "TLM is a more reliable LLM that gives high-quality outputs and indicates when it is unsure of the answer to a question, making it suitable for applications where unchecked hallucinations are a show-stopper.<br />\n",
    "Trustworthiness score quantifies how confident you can be that the response is good (higher values indicate greater trustworthiness). These scores combine estimates of both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty to provide an overall gauge of trustworthiness.\n",

    "Read more about TLM API on [Cleanlab Studio's docs](https://help.cleanlab.ai/reference/python/trustworthy_language_model/). For more advanced usage, feel free to refer to the [quickstart tutorial](https://help.cleanlab.ai/tutorials/tlm/).\n",
