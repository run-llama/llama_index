    "Baseten offers two main ways for inference.\n",
    "1. Model APIs are public endpoints for popular open source models (GPT-OSS, Kimi K2, DeepSeek etc) where you can directly use a frontier model via slug e.g.  `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3-0324` and you will be charged on a per-token basis. You can find the list of supported models here: https://docs.baseten.co/development/model-apis/overview#supported-models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Dedicated deployments are useful for serving custom models where you want to autoscale production workloads and have fine-grain configuration. You need to deploy a model in your Baseten dashboard and provide the 8 character model id like `abcd1234`.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, we set the `model_apis` parameter to `True`. If you want to use a dedicated deployment, you must set the `model_apis` parameter to `False` when instantiating the Baseten object."

    "\n",
    "(1) In the integation, `acomplete` async function is implemented using the aiohttp library, an asynchronous HTTP client in python. The function invokes the async_predict at the approriate Baseten model endpoint, then the user receives a response with the request_id if successful. The user can then check the status or cancel the async_predict request using the returned request_id.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Once the model finishes executing the request, the async result will be posted to the user provided webhook endpoint. The user's endpoint is responsible for validating the webhook signature for security, then processing and storing the output.\n",
