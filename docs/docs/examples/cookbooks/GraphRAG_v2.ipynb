    "# GraphRAG Implementation with LlamaIndex - V2\n",
    "\n",
    "[GraphRAG (Graphs + Retrieval Augmented Generation)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/graphrag/) combines the strengths of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and Query-Focused Summarization (QFS) to effectively handle complex queries over large text datasets. While RAG excels in fetching precise information, it struggles with broader queries that require thematic understanding, a challenge that QFS addresses but cannot scale well. GraphRAG integrates these approaches to offer responsive and thorough querying capabilities across extensive, diverse text corpora.\n",

    "This notebook provides guidance on constructing the GraphRAG pipeline using the LlamaIndex PropertyGraph abstractions using Neo4J.\n",

    "\n",
    "The GraphRAGExtractor class is designed to extract triples (subject-relation-object) from text and enrich them by adding descriptions for entities and relationships to their properties using an LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "This functionality is similar to that of the `SimpleLLMPathExtractor`, but includes additional enhancements to handle entity, relationship descriptions. For guidance on implementation, you may look at similar existing [extractors](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/examples/property_graph/Dynamic_KG_Extraction/?h=comparing).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of its functionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Components:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `llm:` The language model used for extraction.\n",
    "2. `extract_prompt:` A prompt template used to guide the LLM in extracting information.\n",
    "3. `parse_fn:` A function to parse the LLM's output into structured data.\n",
    "4. `max_paths_per_chunk:` Limits the number of triples extracted per text chunk.\n",
    "5. `num_workers:` For parallel processing of multiple text nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Main Methods:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `__call__:` The entry point for processing a list of text nodes.\n",
    "2. `acall:` An asynchronous version of __call__ for improved performance.\n",
    "3. `_aextract:` The core method that processes each individual node.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Extraction Process:**\n",
    "\n",
    "For each input node (chunk of text):\n",
    "1. It sends the text to the LLM along with the extraction prompt.\n",
    "2. The LLM's response is parsed to extract entities, relationships, descriptions for entities and relations.\n",
    "3. Entities are converted into EntityNode objects. Entity description is stored in metadata\n",
    "4. Relationships are converted into Relation objects. Relationship description is stored in metadata.\n",
    "5. These are added to the node's metadata under KG_NODES_KEY and KG_RELATIONS_KEY.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** In the current implementation, we are using only relationship descriptions. In the next implementation, we will utilize entity descriptions during the retrieval stage."

    "\n",
    "The GraphRAGQueryEngine class is a custom query engine designed to process queries using the GraphRAG approach. It leverages the community summaries generated by the GraphRAGStore to answer user queries. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Main Components:**\n",
    "\n",
    "`graph_store:` An instance of GraphRAGStore, which contains the community summaries.\n",
    "`llm:` A Language Model (LLM) used for generating and aggregating answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Methods:**\n",
    "\n",
    "`custom_query(query_str: str)`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. This is the main entry point for processing a query. It retrieves community summaries, generates answers from each summary, and then aggregates these answers into a final response.\n",
    "\n",
    "`generate_answer_from_summary(community_summary, query):`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generates an answer for the query based on a single community summary.\n",
    "Uses the LLM to interpret the community summary in the context of the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "`aggregate_answers(community_answers):`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Combines individual answers from different communities into a coherent final response.\n",
    "2. Uses the LLM to synthesize multiple perspectives into a single, concise answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Query Processing Flow:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Retrieve community summaries from the graph store.\n",
    "2. For each community summary, generate a specific answer to the query.\n",
    "3. Aggregate all community-specific answers into a final, coherent response.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example usage:**\n",
