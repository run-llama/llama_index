      " Paul Graham worked on writing and programming outside of school. He wrote short stories and tried writing programs on the IBM 1401, which was used for data processing in his school district. He and his friend Rich Draves got permission to use the 1401 in the basement of their junior high school. He was puzzled by the 1401 and couldn't figure out what to do with it, but later got a microcomputer and started programming. He also worked on model rockets and did some painting.  He didn't plan to study programming in college, but instead studied philosophy, which he found boring. He then switched to AI and started writing essays.  He worked on various projects, including building an office in a former candy factory and having dinner parties for his friends.  He also started Y Combinator with Jessica Livingston and Robert Tappan Morris.  He wrote many essays, which were later collected into a book called Hackers & Painters.  He also worked on spam filters and continued to paint.  He gave talks and realized that he should stop procrastinating about angel investing, which led to the founding of Y Combinator.\n"
