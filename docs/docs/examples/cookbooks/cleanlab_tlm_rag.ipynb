    "# Trustworthy RAG with the Trustworthy Language Model\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to use Cleanlab's [Trustworthy Language Model](https://cleanlab.ai/blog/trustworthy-language-model/) (TLM) in any RAG system, to score the trustworthiness of answers and improve overall reliability of the RAG system.\n",
    "We recommend first completing the [TLM example tutorial](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/llm/cleanlab/).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** has become popular for building LLM-based Question-Answer systems in domains where LLMs alone suffer from: hallucination, knowledge gaps, and factual inaccuracies. However, RAG systems often still produce unreliable responses, because they depend on LLMs that are fundamentally unreliable. Cleanlab's Trustworthy Language Model (TLM) offers a solution by providing trustworthiness scores to assess and improve response quality, **independent of your RAG architecture or retrieval and indexing processes**. \n",
    "\n",
    "To diagnose when RAG answers cannot be trusted, simply swap your existing LLM that is generating answers based on the retrieved context with TLM. This notebook showcases this for a standard RAG system, based off a tutorial in the popular [LlamaIndex](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/) framework. Here we merely replace the LLM used in the LlamaIndex tutorial with TLM, and showcase some of the benefits. TLM can be similarly inserted into *any* other RAG framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG is all about connecting LLMs to data, to better inform their answers. This tutorial uses Nvidia's Q1 FY2024 earnings report as an example dataset.\n",
    "Use the following commands to download the data (earnings report) and store it in a directory named `data/`."
