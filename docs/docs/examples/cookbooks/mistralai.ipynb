They also invested in their Express Drive program, which provides drivers access to rental cars they can use for ridesharing. Additionally, they made investments in their Driver Centers, Mobile Services, and related partnerships that offer drivers affordable and convenient vehicle maintenance services. Furthermore, they invested in their proprietary technology, including mapping, routing, payments, in-app navigation, matching technologies, and data science to make their network more efficient and seamless to use. They also acquired certain money market deposit accounts and cash in transit from payment processors for credit and debit card transactions. Short-term investments consisted of commercial paper, certificates of deposit, corporate bonds, and term deposits, which mature in 12 months or less.
