    "# GraphRAG Implementation with LlamaIndex\n",
    "\n",
    "[GraphRAG (Graphs + Retrieval Augmented Generation)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/graphrag/) combines the strengths of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and Query-Focused Summarization (QFS) to effectively handle complex queries over large text datasets. While RAG excels in fetching precise information, it struggles with broader queries that require thematic understanding, a challenge that QFS addresses but cannot scale well. GraphRAG integrates these approaches to offer responsive and thorough querying capabilities across extensive, diverse text corpora.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides guidance on constructing the GraphRAG pipeline using the LlamaIndex PropertyGraph abstractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** This is an approximate implementation of GraphRAG. We are currently developing a series of cookbooks that will detail the exact implementation of GraphRAG."

    "## GraphRAG Aproach\n",
    "\n",
    "The GraphRAG involves two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Graph Generation - Creates Graph, builds communities and its summaries over the given document.\n",
    "2. Answer to the Query - Use summaries of the communities created from step-1 to answer the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Graph Generation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Source Documents to Text Chunks:** Source documents are divided into smaller text chunks for easier processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Text Chunks to Element Instances:** Each text chunk is analyzed to identify and extract entities and relationships, resulting in a list of tuples that represent these elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Element Instances to Element Summaries:** The extracted entities and relationships are summarized into descriptive text blocks for each element using the LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Element Summaries to Graph Communities:** These entities, relationships and summaries form a graph, which is subsequently partitioned into communities using algorithms using Heirarchical Leiden to establish a hierarchical structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Graph Communities to Community Summaries:** The LLM generates summaries for each community, providing insights into the dataset’s overall topical structure and semantics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answering the Query:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Community Summaries to Global Answers:** The summaries of the communities are utilized to respond to user queries. This involves generating intermediate answers, which are then consolidated into a comprehensive global answer.\n"

    "Here are the different components we implemented to build all of the processes mentioned above.\n",

    "1. **Source Documents to Text Chunks:** Implemented using `SentenceSplitter` with a chunk size of 1024 and chunk overlap of 20 tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Text Chunks to Element Instances AND Element Instances to Element Summaries:** Implemented using `GraphRAGExtractor`.\n",

So, we\\u2019ll see if they can close on this thing.\\u201d\\nHopkins has received co-signs from New England team leaders like Mac Jones and Matthew Judon, and the Patriots reportedly are optimistic they can add the five-time Pro Bowl selection.

Despite the volatility of recent months, we see a number of strong tailwinds in certain sectors \\u2014 particularly those that solve big societal problems. One such problem is growing healthcare costs, which will put more pressure on social-security systems and household budgets. Later in this letter we profile Henry Schein, Inc. (NASDAQ:HSIC), the largest distributor of dental and medical products and services globally. Companies like Henry Schein have the potential to control the growth in healthcare costs, while promoting access to underserved communities.\\nAt the same time, healthcare cost pressures are escalating. To make matters worse, healthcare has worse labour shortages than most industries, while productivity improvements are hard to come by.4 In almost every country, health spending is forecast to form an increasing share of GDP in the coming years.\\nAt Generation, we look for companies that can provide a solution to these long-term challenges. More specifically, we look for healthcare companies that reduce costs and drive efficiency; that improve clinical outcomes; and that improve access to care.

    "\n",
    "The GraphRAGExtractor class is designed to extract triples (subject-relation-object) from text and enrich them by adding descriptions for entities and relationships to their properties using an LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "This functionality is similar to that of the `SimpleLLMPathExtractor`, but includes additional enhancements to handle entity, relationship descriptions. For guidance on implementation, you may look at similar existing [extractors](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/examples/property_graph/Dynamic_KG_Extraction/?h=comparing).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of its functionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Components:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `llm:` The language model used for extraction.\n",
    "2. `extract_prompt:` A prompt template used to guide the LLM in extracting information.\n",
    "3. `parse_fn:` A function to parse the LLM's output into structured data.\n",
    "4. `max_paths_per_chunk:` Limits the number of triples extracted per text chunk.\n",
    "5. `num_workers:` For parallel processing of multiple text nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Main Methods:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `__call__:` The entry point for processing a list of text nodes.\n",
    "2. `acall:` An asynchronous version of __call__ for improved performance.\n",
    "3. `_aextract:` The core method that processes each individual node.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Extraction Process:**\n",
    "\n",
    "For each input node (chunk of text):\n",
    "1. It sends the text to the LLM along with the extraction prompt.\n",
    "2. The LLM's response is parsed to extract entities, relationships, descriptions for entities and relations.\n",
    "3. Entities are converted into EntityNode objects. Entity description is stored in metadata\n",
    "4. Relationships are converted into Relation objects. Relationship description is stored in metadata.\n",
    "5. These are added to the node's metadata under KG_NODES_KEY and KG_RELATIONS_KEY.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** In the current implementation, we are using only relationship descriptions. In the next implementation, we will utilize entity descriptions during the retrieval stage."

    "\n",
    "The GraphRAGQueryEngine class is a custom query engine designed to process queries using the GraphRAG approach. It leverages the community summaries generated by the GraphRAGStore to answer user queries. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Main Components:**\n",
    "\n",
    "`graph_store:` An instance of GraphRAGStore, which contains the community summaries.\n",
    "`llm:` A Language Model (LLM) used for generating and aggregating answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Methods:**\n",
    "\n",
    "`custom_query(query_str: str)`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. This is the main entry point for processing a query. It retrieves community summaries, generates answers from each summary, and then aggregates these answers into a final response.\n",
    "\n",
    "`generate_answer_from_summary(community_summary, query):`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generates an answer for the query based on a single community summary.\n",
    "Uses the LLM to interpret the community summary in the context of the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "`aggregate_answers(community_answers):`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Combines individual answers from different communities into a coherent final response.\n",
    "2. Uses the LLM to synthesize multiple perspectives into a single, concise answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Query Processing Flow:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Retrieve community summaries from the graph store.\n",
    "2. For each community summary, generate a specific answer to the query.\n",
    "3. Aggregate all community-specific answers into a final, coherent response.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example usage:**\n",
