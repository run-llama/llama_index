    "\n",
    "This tutorial shows how to build **trustworthy** RAG applications: use [Cleanlab](https://help.cleanlab.ai/tlm/) to score the trustworthiness of every LLM response, and diagnose *why* responses are untrustworthy via evaluations of specific RAG components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Powered by [state-of-the-art uncertainty estimation](https://cleanlab.ai/blog/trustworthy-language-model/), Cleanlab trustworthiness scores help you automatically catch incorrect responses from any LLM application. Trust scoring happens in real-time and does not require any data labeling or model training work. Cleanlab provides additional real-time Evals for specific RAG components like the retrieved context, which help you root cause *why* RAG responses were incorrect. Cleanlab makes it easy to prevent inaccurate responses from your RAG app, and avoid losing your users' trust."
