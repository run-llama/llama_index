He used an early version of Fortran as the programming language. The author faced challenges in figuring out what to do with the computer, as the only form of input was data stored on punched cards, and he didn't have any.

He started using it in 9th grade, around the age of 13 or 14. The programming language he used was an early version of Fortran. The author faced several challenges while using this computer. The only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards, and he didn't have any data stored on punched cards. The only other option was to do things that didn't rely on any input, like calculate approximations of pi, but he didn't know enough math to do anything interesting of that type. Therefore, he couldn't figure out what to do with it and in retrospect, he believes there's not much he could have done with it. \n",

      "GPT-4 Relevancy Feedback: The response accurately reflects the context provided. The response correctly identifies the two primary objectives of the work as the development and release of Llama 2, a collection of pretrained and fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), and the optimization of these models for dialogue use cases. This is in line with the information provided in the abstract of the context. The response also correctly states the range of parameters for the large language models developed as being from 7 billion to 70 billion, which is also confirmed in the context. Therefore, the response is in line with the context information provided. [RESULT] YES\n",

    "\n",
    "1. The cost for evaluation (approx.): `$2.167` for Prometheus Model and `$22` for GPT4.\n",
    "2. The Prometheus model, though offering more detailed feedback than GPT-4, occasionally provides incorrect feedback, necessitating cautious application.\n",
    "3. If a generated answer lacks certain facts present in the reference answer, the Prometheus model applies stricter penalties to scores than GPT-4.\n",
    "4. The faithfulness and relevancy feedback of Promethes shows more hallucinations/ wrong interpretations in the feedback compared to GPT-4.\n",
    "5. The commonality between faithfulness and relevancy scores of Promethes and GPT-4 is different across two datasets and so should be used cautiously in production.\n",

    "Note: The endpoint on HF is served on AWS Nvidia A100G · 1x GPU · 80 GB which costs $6.5/h. We used [Prometheus model](https://huggingface.co/kaist-ai/prometheus-13b-v1.0) for the analysis here. We also made similar analysis with [GPTQ Quantized version](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/prometheus-13B-v1.0-GPTQ) of [Prometheus model](https://huggingface.co/kaist-ai/prometheus-13b-v1.0) and observed abit more hallucinations in feedback compared to original unquantized model. Thanks to authors of the paper and [Tom Jobbins](https://twitter.com/TheBlokeAI) for providing the quantized version of the model."
