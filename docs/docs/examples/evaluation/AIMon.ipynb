    "## AIMon's LlamaIndex Extension for LLM Response Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces AIMon's evaluators for the LlamaIndex framework, which are designed to assess the quality and accuracy of responses generated by language models (LLMs) integrated into LlamaIndex. Below is an overview of all available evaluators:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hallucination Evaluator**: Detects when a model generates information not supported by the provided context (hallucinations).\n",
    "- **Guideline Evaluator**: Ensures model responses follow predefined instructions and guidelines.\n",
    "- **Completeness Evaluator**: Checks whether the response fully addresses all aspects of the query or task.\n",
    "- **Conciseness Evaluator**: Evaluates if the response is brief yet complete, avoiding unnecessary verbosity.\n",
    "- **Toxicity Evaluator**: Flags harmful, offensive, or inappropriate language in the response.\n",
    "- **Context Relevance Evaluator**: Assesses the relevance and accuracy of the provided context in supporting the model's response.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will focus on utilizing the **Hallucination Evaluator**, **Guideline Evaluator**, and **Context Relevance Evaluator** to improve your RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn more about AIMon, check out these resources:: [Website](https://www.aimon.ai/) and [Documentation](https://docs.aimon.ai/)"
