    "\n",
    "[SLIDE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17952) (Sliding Localized Information for Document Extraction) is a chunking method introduced to enhance entity and relationship extraction in long documents, especially for low-resource languages. It was designed to support GraphRAG pipelines by embedding localized context into each chunk without exceeding the context window of the LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "`SlideNodeParser` faithfully implements a almost similar version of this method to improve downstream retrieval and reasoning quality by generating short, meaningful context using a sliding window of nearby chunks. This technique is proven useful for Graph based Retrieval Augmented Generaration techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the technique as outlined in the paper:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Given a document D and a list of base chunks (C1, C2, ..., Ck) segmented by sentence boundaries and token count, SLIDE builds local context for each chunk using a fixed-size sliding window of neighboring chunks. This context is appended to the chunk using an LLM-generated summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "The window size is a hyperparameter defined based on the modelâ€™s context length and compute budget. Each chunk Ci is enriched by including a few preceding and succeeding chunks (e.g., 5 on each side), resulting in a total of window_size + 1 inputs sent to the LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is repeated for every chunk in the document. The result is a collection of chunks embedded with richer, window-specific local context, which significantly improves the quality of knowledge graphs and search retrieval, especially in multilingual or resource-constrained settings.\n",
    "```\n",
