    "4. A `review_report` tool to review the report and provide feedback.\n",

      "The history of the internet is a fascinating journey from a government research project to a global network that has transformed the way we communicate, work, and live. This report provides a brief overview of the key milestones in the development of the internet, the World Wide Web, and the internet's evolution in the 21st century.\n",

      "## Development of the Internet\n",
      "\n",
      "The origins of the internet date back to the 1960s, when it was conceived as a means for government researchers to share information. This led to the creation of ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network), which was the first network to implement the TCP/IP protocol suite. TCP/IP became the foundational technology for the modern internet. On January 1, 1983, ARPANET and the Defense Data Network officially adopted TCP/IP, marking the official birth of the internet.\n",

      "## Development of the World Wide Web\n",
      "\n",
      "The World Wide Web was developed in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist working at CERN. The web was initially designed to facilitate information sharing among scientists and research institutes globally. Berners-Lee created the first web browser and web server, introducing the concept of hyperlinks, which allowed users to navigate between different documents on the web seamlessly.\n",

      "In the 21st century, the internet has evolved into a vast global network connecting billions of devices and users. It has revolutionized communication, commerce, entertainment, and education, among other fields. The development of broadband technology, mobile internet, and social media platforms has further accelerated the internet's growth and impact, making it an integral part of daily life for people around the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "The internet continues to evolve, with ongoing advancements in technology and infrastructure shaping its future. As it grows, the internet remains a powerful tool for innovation, connectivity, and information sharing, influencing nearly every aspect of modern society.\n"
