      "\n",
      "**Financial Data:**\n",
      "1. **Uber** did not disclose specific revenue figures in the provided information, focusing more on their financial management practices and the quality of their financial instruments. They emphasized the high credit quality of their cash equivalents and securities, and the use of GAAP-compliant financial statements influenced by estimates considering the COVID-19 impact.\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. **Lyft** reported total revenue of $3,208,323,000 for 2021, with a significant drop due to the COVID-19 pandemic and a partial recovery, still below pre-pandemic levels. This gives a clear numeric insight into their financial status during the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Risk Factors:**\n",
      "1. **Uber's** key risk factors include concentration of credit risk, with their financial assets placed in high-credit-quality institutions, and various uncertainties that could affect their forward-looking statements and actual results. They manage risks related to their financial estimates and the broader economic impacts of the pandemic.\n",

      "**Conclusion:**\n",
      "While Uber's discussion focuses on the management of high-quality financial assets and the broader implications of their financial estimates, Lyft provides more concrete financial results and a detailed list of operational and market risks. Lyft's explicit revenue figures and detailed risk enumeration offer a clearer picture of their financial health and challenges compared to Uber's more generalized financial overview.
