      "Got output: The author, Paul Graham, had a strong interest in writing and programming from a young age. They started writing short stories and experimenting with programming in high school. In college, they initially studied philosophy but switched to studying artificial intelligence. However, they realized that the AI being practiced at the time was not going to lead to true understanding of natural language. This led them to focus on Lisp programming and eventually write a book about Lisp hacking. Despite being in a PhD program in computer science, the author also developed a passion for art and decided to pursue it further. They attended the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence but found that it did not teach them much. They then returned to the US and got a job at a software company. Afterward, they attended the Rhode Island School of Design but dropped out due to the focus on developing a signature style rather than teaching the fundamentals of art. They then moved to New York City and became interested in the World Wide Web, eventually starting a company called Viaweb. They later founded Y Combinator, an investment firm, and created Hacker News.\n",

With an equally strong passion for art, he studied at the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence and briefly at the Rhode Island School of Design before immersing himself in the tech industry by starting Viaweb and later founding the influential startup accelerator Y Combinator. He also created Hacker News, a social news website focused on computer science and entrepreneurship. Graham's life reflects a blend of technology, entrepreneurship, and the arts.\n"
