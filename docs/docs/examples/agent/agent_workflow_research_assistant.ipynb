It found that stress did not negatively impact exercise participation among habitually active adults with such equipment. The study suggests that habitual exercise may buffer the impact of stress on regular moderate to vigorous activity, and highlights the potential role of home-based internet-connected exercise equipment in this buffering.\n",
