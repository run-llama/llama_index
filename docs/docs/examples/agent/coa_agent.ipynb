    "The chain-of-abstraction (CoA) LlamaPack implements a generalized version of the strategy decsribed in the [original CoA paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17464).\n",
    "\n",
    "By prompting the LLM to write function calls in a chain-of-thought format, we can execute both simple and complex combinations of function calls needed to execute a task.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LLM is prompted to write a response containing function calls, for example, a CoA plan might look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "After buying the apples, Sally has [FUNC add(3, 2) = y1] apples. \n",
    "Then, the wizard casts a spell to multiply the number of apples by 3, \n",
    "resulting in [FUNC multiply(y1, 3) = y2] apples.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "From there, the function calls can be parsed into a dependency graph, and executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the values in the CoA are replaced with their actual results.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an extension to the original paper, we also run the LLM a final time, to rewrite the response in a more readable and user-friendly way.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** In the original paper, the authors fine-tuned an LLM specifically for this, and also for specific functions and datasets. As such, only capable LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) will be (hopefully) reliable for this without finetuning."
