# LlamaIndex

> LlamaIndex is a comprehensive framework for building production-ready data-backed LLM applications, specializing in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and autonomous agentic workflows that connect language models to your private data.

## What is LlamaIndex?

LlamaIndex enables developers to build sophisticated AI applications that combine the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models with real-world data sources. Unlike general-purpose LLM frameworks, LlamaIndex is specifically designed for applications that need to work with private, proprietary, or domain-specific data.

The framework addresses the fundamental challenge of LLMs: they are trained on public data with knowledge cutoffs, but most valuable business applications require access to private documents, databases, APIs, and real-time information. LlamaIndex bridges this gap through advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques and agentic workflows.

Core differentiators include:
- 100+ data connectors for ingesting diverse data sources (PDFs, databases, APIs, cloud services)
- Advanced RAG techniques (hybrid retrieval, auto-merging, recursive retrieval, contextual retrieval)
- Support for 40+ LLM providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, and local models (Ollama, vLLM)
- Comprehensive production infrastructure (LlamaCloud, observability, evaluation frameworks)
- Unique event-driven workflow orchestration with human-in-the-loop capabilities
- Async-first architecture designed for enterprise scalability with microservice deployment

## Core Architecture

### The RAG Pipeline

At its heart, LlamaIndex implements a sophisticated RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline:

1. **Data Loading**: Documents are ingested using specialized readers for different data sources
2. **Parsing & Chunking**: Raw data is split into manageable chunks while preserving semantic meaning
3. **Indexing**: Chunks are converted to embeddings and stored in vector databases or other index structures
4. **Retrieval**: Relevant chunks are retrieved based on query similarity and other criteria
5. **Synthesis**: Retrieved context is combined with the original query to generate accurate responses

### Document Processing

LlamaIndex transforms raw documents into a structured `Document` and `Node` representation:

- **Documents**: Represent entire files or data sources with metadata
- **Nodes**: Smaller chunks of documents optimized for retrieval and processing
- **Metadata**: Rich context including source, timestamps, relationships, and custom attributes

The framework uses sophisticated parsing strategies:
- **Sentence Splitters**: Preserve semantic boundaries while maintaining optimal chunk sizes
- **Token-based Splitting**: Ensure chunks fit within LLM context windows
- **Hierarchical Parsing**: Maintain document structure (headings, sections, tables)
- **Semantic Chunking**: Group related content using embedding similarity

### Indexing Strategies

LlamaIndex supports multiple indexing approaches for different use cases:

**Vector Store Index**
- Primary indexing method using semantic embeddings
- Stores document chunks as high-dimensional vectors
- Enables similarity-based retrieval using cosine similarity or other metrics
- Supports 30+ vector store backends (Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma, etc.)

**Property Graph Index**
- Graph-based indexing that captures relationships between entities
- Extracts entities and relationships from documents automatically
- Enables graph traversal and relationship-aware retrieval
- Integrates with Neo4j, Neptune, and other graph databases

**Keyword Index**
- Traditional keyword-based search using TF-IDF or BM25
- Useful for exact phrase matching and traditional search patterns
- Can be combined with vector search for hybrid retrieval

**Tree Index**
- Hierarchical organization of documents
- Builds summary trees for efficient multi-level retrieval
- Optimized for summarization and high-level question answering

### Advanced Retrieval Techniques

**Hybrid Retrieval**
Combines multiple retrieval methods for better accuracy:
- Vector similarity search for semantic matching
- Keyword search for exact phrase matching
- Graph traversal for relationship discovery
- Results are merged and re-ranked using fusion algorithms

**Auto-Merging Retrieval**
Intelligently combines retrieved chunks:
- Retrieves initial set of relevant chunks
- Automatically merges adjacent or overlapping chunks
- Reconstructs larger context when needed
- Reduces information fragmentation

**Recursive Retrieval**
Multi-step retrieval process:
- First retrieves document summaries or high-level chunks
- Uses initial results to guide deeper retrieval into specific sections
- Enables efficient search through large document collections
- Particularly effective for hierarchical documents

**Contextual Retrieval**
Enhances chunks with additional context:
- Prepends document-level context to each chunk
- Maintains global document understanding during retrieval
- Improves relevance scoring and reduces hallucinations
- Based on Anthropic's contextual retrieval research

## Query Processing

### Query Engines

Query engines handle standalone questions and return structured responses:

**Basic Query Flow**
1. Query is processed and potentially transformed
2. Relevant context is retrieved from indexes
3. Context and query are sent to LLM for response generation
4. Response is post-processed and returned

**Response Modes**
- **Compact**: Combines retrieved chunks into single LLM call
- **Refine**: Iteratively refines answer using multiple LLM calls
- **Tree Summarize**: Hierarchically processes chunks for better synthesis
- **Generation**: Direct generation without retrieval for knowledge-based queries

### Chat Engines

Chat engines maintain conversation state and handle multi-turn interactions:

**Conversation Memory**
- Maintains chat history across turns
- Implements conversation summarization for long conversations
- Supports custom memory backends (Redis, databases, etc.)
- Balances context retention with token limits

**Context Management**
- Combines conversation history with retrieved context
- Implements context windowing for long conversations
- Maintains topic coherence across turns
- Supports context injection and manipulation

### Agents

Agents are autonomous systems that can use tools, access data, and make decisions:

**Agent Architecture**
- **LLM Brain**: Core reasoning engine (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
- **Memory**: Conversation and working memory management
- **Tools**: Functions the agent can call (search, calculation, API calls)
- **Planning**: Multi-step reasoning and task decomposition

**Agent Types**

**ReAct Agents**
- Implement Reasoning + Acting pattern
- Alternate between reasoning about the problem and taking actions
- Maintain internal thought process for transparency
- Effective for complex, multi-step tasks

**Function Calling Agents**
- Use LLM provider's native function calling capabilities
- More reliable tool usage with structured outputs
- Support parallel function calls for efficiency
- Work with OpenAI, Anthropic, and other function-calling models

**Code Act Agents**
- Generate and execute code to solve problems
- Particularly effective for data analysis and computation
- Can create visualizations, perform calculations, and manipulate data
- Sandbox execution for security

**Multi-Agent Systems**
- Coordinate multiple specialized agents
- Enable agent handoffs and collaboration
- Support hierarchical agent structures
- Useful for complex workflows requiring different expertise
