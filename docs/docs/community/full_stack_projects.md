# Full-Stack Projects

We've created both tooling and a variety of example projects (all open-source) to help you get started building a full-stack LLM application.

## create-llama

`create-llama` is a command-line tool that will generate a full-stack application template for you. It supports both FastAPI, Vercel, and Node backends. This is one of the easiest ways to get started!

## Full-Stack Applications

The LlamaIndex team has also built some in-house projects - all of them open-sourced with MIT license - that you can use out of the box, or use as a template to kickstart your own project.
