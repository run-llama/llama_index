# Chatbots

Chatbots are another extremely popular use case for LLMs. Instead of a single question and answer, a chatbot can handle multiple back-and-forth queries and answers, getting clarification or answering follow-up questions.

LlamaIndex gives you the tools to build knowledge-augmented chatbots and agents.
