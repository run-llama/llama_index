# 🔍 Retriever
## Concept
Retrievers are responsible for fetching the most relevant context given a user query (or chat message).  

It can be built on top of [Indices](/how_to/index/root.md), but can also be defined independently.
It is used as a key building block in [Query Engines](/how_to/query_engine/root.md) (and [Chat Engines](/how_to/chat_engine/root.md)) for retrieving relevant context.
