After that, he stayed there alone with<br>Wilson until dawn.<br><br>About three o’clock the quality of Wilson’s incoherent muttering<br>changed—he grew quieter and began to talk about the yellow car. He<br>announced that he had a way of finding out whom the yellow car<br>belonged to, and then he blurted out that a couple of months ago his<br>wife had come from the city with her face bruised and her nose<br>swollen.<br><br>But when he heard himself say this, he flinched and began to cry “Oh,<br>my God!” again in his groaning voice.

The<br>other car, the one going toward New York, came to rest a hundred yards<br>beyond, and its driver hurried back to where Myrtle Wilson, her life<br>violently extinguished, knelt in the road and mingled her thick dark<br>blood with the dust.<br><br>Michaelis and this man reached her first, but when they had torn open<br>her shirtwaist, still damp with perspiration, they saw that her left<br>breast was swinging loose like a flap, and there was no need to listen<br>for the heart beneath.
