    "# 🦙 Using `MultiStepQueryEngine`: Tuning Context (k) vs. Hops with Arize Phoenix\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:**\n",
    "This notebook optimizes the LlamaIndex `MultiStepQueryEngine` for complex reasoning tasks. We perform a sensitivity analysis using a **subset of the HotpotQA dataset ** to understand the trade-offs between retrieval depth and reasoning steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tools Used:**\n",
    "* **Engine:** `MultiStepQueryEngine` (Sequential multi-hop reasoning)\n",
    "* **Dataset:** HotpotQA (Wiki-based complex QA)\n",
    "* **Observability:** Arize Phoenix (Trace analysis & Evaluation)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Experiment:**\n",
    "We sweep through different values of `similarity_top_k` (context amount) and `num_steps` (reasoning depth) to find the \"sweet spot\" where the agent answers correctly without unnecessary latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Results:**\n",

    "Samples: 30\n",
