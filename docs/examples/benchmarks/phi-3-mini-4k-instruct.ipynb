OpenAI primarily presents its products as productivity tools, focusing on simple utilities for getting things done, such as the ChatGPT AI that can now provide voice responses and offer pep talks. On the other hand, Meta, which is in the entertainment business, is building its own uses for generative AI and voices, creating personality-driven chatbots for its messaging apps. These chatbots are designed to mimic celebrities and offer unique interactions, such as AI Taylor Swift or MrBeast.
