                        "The population of Berlin is estimated to be around 3.7 million inhabitants, making it the most populous city in Germany. It is home to a diverse population, with people from over 190 countries living in the city. The largest religious denomination recorded in 2018 was the Protestant regional church body—the Evangelical Church of Berlin-Brandenburg-Silesian Upper Lusatia (EKBO)—a united church. EKBO is a member of the Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD) and Union Evangelischer Kirchen (UEK). According to the EKBO, their membership accounted for 18.7 percent of the local population, while the Roman Catholic Church had 8.5 percent of residents registered as its members. About 2.7% of the population identify with other Christian denominations (mostly Eastern Orthodox, but also various Protestants). According to the Berlin residents register, in 2018 14.9 percent were members of the Evangelical Church, and 8.5 percent were members of the Catholic Church. In 2009, approximately 249,000 Muslims were reported by the Office of Statistics to be members of mosques and Islamic religious organizations in Berlin, while in 2016, the newspaper Der Tagesspiegel estimated that about 350,000 Muslims observed Ramadan in Berlin. In 2019, about 437,000 registered residents, 11.6% of the total, reported having a migration background from one of the Member states of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. Berlin is also home to at least 180,000 Turkish and Turkish German residents, making it the largest Turkish community outside of Turkey. The faithful of the different religions and denominations maintain many places of worship in Berlin, including 36 Baptist congregations, 29 New Apostolic Churches, 15 United Methodist churches, eight Free Evangelical Congregations, four Churches of Christ, Scientist (1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 11th), six congregations of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, an Old Catholic church, and an Anglican church. Berlin also has more than 80 mosques, ten synagogues, and two Buddhist temples. Berlin is the capital of the Federal Republic of Germany and the seat of the German Chancellor (Prime Minister), housed in the Chancellery building, the Bundeskanzleramt. The city is home to many international corporations, government ministries, and embassies, and is a major center of business, finance, tourism, and culture. Berlin is also a popular destination for conventions and conferences, hosting 195 international meetings in 2015. It is also well known for its numerous cafés, street musicians, beach bars along the Spree River, flea markets, boutique shops and pop-up stores, which are a source for recreation and leisure. Berlin is the host city for the 2006 FIFA World Cup final, the IAAF World Championships in Athletics, the Basketball Euroleague Final Four, the FIBA EuroBasket 2015, the UEFA Champions League Final, and the 2023 Special Olympics World Summer Games. Berlin is home to the oldest park in the city, the Volkspark in Friedrichshain, as well as the world's largest inner-city open space, Tempelhofer Feld. Potsdam, on the southwestern periphery of Berlin, is known for its interconnected lakes and cultural landmarks. Berliners are registered in over 2,300 sport and fitness clubs, and the city operates more than 60 public indoor and outdoor swimming pools. Professional clubs representing the most important spectator team sports in Germany, such as Hertha BSC, are based in Berlin.\u001b[0m\n",
