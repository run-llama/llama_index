A core use case is building a generalized QA interface enabling knowledge synthesis over complex questions.\n",

      "Uber has been a game-changer in the world of ride-hailing and beyond. From revolutionizing how we get from point A to point B, to pioneering new services like Uber Eats and Uber Freight, the company has always been at the forefront of innovation. However, like any trailblazer, Uber faces a myriad of challenges that could impact its future. Let's dive into some of the headwinds that Uber is currently navigating.\n",
      "\n",
      "First up, data security breaches. In today's digital age, data is gold, and Uber holds a treasure trove of information. This makes the company a prime target for cyber-attacks. A breach could lead to severe legal liabilities, financial losses, and a tarnished reputation. Uber must continuously bolster its defenses to protect user data, a task that is both critical and relentless.\n",
