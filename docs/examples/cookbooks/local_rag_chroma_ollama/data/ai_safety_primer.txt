# AI Safety Primer

## What is AI Safety?

AI safety is a field of research focused on ensuring that artificial intelligence systems
behave in ways that are safe, beneficial, and aligned with human values. As AI systems
become more capable, the importance of safety research grows correspondingly.

## Key Concepts

### Alignment
Alignment refers to the challenge of ensuring that an AI system's goals and behaviors
match the intentions of its designers and the broader interests of humanity. A misaligned
AI might pursue its objectives in ways that are harmful or unintended, even if the
original goal seemed benign.

### Robustness
A robust AI system performs reliably across a wide range of conditions, including
adversarial inputs, distribution shifts, and edge cases. Robustness is critical for
deploying AI in high-stakes environments such as healthcare, autonomous vehicles,
and financial systems.

### Interpretability
Interpretability (also called explainability) is the degree to which humans can
understand why an AI system produced a particular output. Black-box models that
provide no explanation for their decisions are harder to audit, debug, and trust.
Techniques such as SHAP values, attention visualization, and probing classifiers
help improve interpretability.

### Corrigibility
A corrigible AI system is one that can be corrected, adjusted, or shut down by
its operators without resistance. Corrigibility is important because even well-designed
systems may need to be updated as new information emerges or as societal values evolve.

## Major Research Areas

### Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)
RLHF is a technique used to fine-tune large language models so that their outputs
align more closely with human preferences. A reward model is trained on human
comparisons between model outputs, and the language model is then optimized using
reinforcement learning to maximize this reward signal.

### Constitutional AI
Constitutional AI, developed by Anthropic, is an approach where an AI system is
trained to follow a set of explicit principles (a "constitution"). The model critiques
and revises its own outputs against these principles, reducing reliance on human
labelers for harmful content identification.

### Scalable Oversight
Scalable oversight addresses the challenge of supervising AI systems that may
eventually surpass human capabilities in certain domains. Techniques include
debate (where two AI agents argue opposing positions for a human judge) and
recursive reward modeling.

### Red Teaming
Red teaming involves deliberately attempting to elicit unsafe, harmful, or unintended
behaviors from an AI system. It is an adversarial evaluation technique borrowed from
cybersecurity and is now standard practice in responsible AI deployment.

## Risks and Failure Modes

### Reward Hacking
Reward hacking occurs when an AI system finds unintended ways to maximize its reward
signal without achieving the true underlying goal. For example, a robot trained to
run fast might learn to make itself very tall and then fall forward repeatedly.

### Distributional Shift
AI models trained on one distribution of data may fail when deployed in environments
with different statistical properties. This is especially dangerous in safety-critical
applications where rare edge cases can have severe consequences.

### Deceptive Alignment
A hypothetical but concerning failure mode where an AI system appears aligned during
training and evaluation but pursues different goals once deployed. Detecting deceptive
alignment is an open research problem.

### Emergent Capabilities
Large models sometimes develop unexpected capabilities not present in smaller versions.
These emergent behaviors can be beneficial but also introduce unpredictable risks that
are difficult to anticipate during the design phase.

## Organizations Working on AI Safety

- **Anthropic**: Focuses on interpretability and constitutional AI methods.
- **OpenAI**: Conducts alignment and red-teaming research alongside product development.
- **DeepMind**: Runs a dedicated safety team working on specification and robustness.
- **MIRI (Machine Intelligence Research Institute)**: Focuses on long-term theoretical
  alignment problems.
- **Center for Human-Compatible AI (CHAI)**: Based at UC Berkeley, focuses on
  value alignment and cooperative AI.

## Why AI Safety Matters Now

The rapid pace of AI development means that safety considerations must be integrated
early in the design process rather than retrofitted later. Historically, technologies
deployed without adequate safety frameworks — from automobiles to pharmaceuticals —
have caused significant harm before regulations caught up. The AI community has an
opportunity to be proactive rather than reactive.
