      "The capabilities of LLMs are remarkable considering the seemingly straightforward nature of the training\n",

      "followed by alignment with human preferences via techniques such as Reinforcement Learning with Human\n",
      "Feedback (RLHF). Although the training methodology is simple, high computational requirements have\n",
      "limited the development of LLMs to a few players. There have been public releases of pretrained LLMs\n",
      "(such as BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022), LLaMa-1 (Touvron et al., 2023), and Falcon (Penedo et al., 2023)) that\n",
      "match the performance of closed pretrained competitors like GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) and Chinchilla\n",
      "(Hoffmann et al., 2022), but none of these models are suitable substitutes for closed “product” LLMs, such\n",
      "as ChatGPT, BARD, and Claude. These closed product LLMs are heavily fine-tuned to align with human\n",
      "preferences, which greatly enhances their usability and safety. This step can require significant costs in\n",

      "on the datasets, to allow Llama 2 to be more widely usable across tasks (e.g., it can be better used for hate\n",
      "speech classification), while avoiding the potential for the accidental demographic erasure sometimes caused\n",
      "by over-scrubbing. Importantly, this allows Llama 2-Chat to generalize more effectively during safety tuning\n",
      "with fewer examples (Welbl et al., 2021; Korbak et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2021). As a result, Llama 2 models\n",
      "should be used carefully and deployed only after significant safety tuning is applied.\n",
      "Demographic Representation: Pronouns.\n",
      "Bias in model generations may result from biases inherited\n",
      "from the training data itself. For instance, Bailey et al. (2022) shows that in massive text corpora, words\n",
      "representing “people” are often used in more similar contexts to words representing “men” than to words\n",
      "representing “women,” and Ganesh et al. (2023) demonstrates that a model’s performance on fairness metrics\n",
      "can be highly dependent on how the model trains on data representing underrepresented demographic\n",
      "groups. Within our English-language training corpus, we computed the frequencies of the most common\n",
      "English pronouns in Table 9a. We observe that He pronouns are generally overrepresented in documents\n",
      "compared to She pronouns, echoing similar frequency differences observed in pronominal usage for similarly\n",
      "sized model pretraining datasets (Chowdhery et al., 2022). This could mean that the model is learning less\n",
      "during pretraining about context that mentions She pronouns, and subsequently may potentially generate He\n",
      "pronouns at a higher rate than She pronouns.\n",
      "Demographic Representation: Identities.\n",
      "We also analyze the representation of different demographic\n",
      "groups in the pretraining data by measuring rates of usage of demographic identity terms from the HolisticBias\n",

      "fine-tuning methods as described in Section 3, with some notable differences related to safety concerns.\n",
      "Specifically, we use the following techniques in safety fine-tuning:\n",
      "1. Supervised Safety Fine-Tuning: We initialize by gathering adversarial prompts and safe demonstra-\n",
      "tions that are then included in the general supervised fine-tuning process (Section 3.1). This teaches\n",
      "the model to align with our safety guidelines even before RLHF, and thus lays the foundation for\n",
      "high-quality human preference data annotation.\n",
      "2. Safety RLHF: Subsequently, we integrate safety in the general RLHF pipeline described in Sec-\n",
      "tion 3.2.2. This includes training a safety-specific reward model and gathering more challenging\n",
      "adversarial prompts for rejection sampling style fine-tuning and PPO optimization.\n",
      "3. Safety Context Distillation: Finally, we refine our RLHF pipeline with context distillation (Askell\n",
      "et al., 2021b). This involves generating safer model responses by prefixing a prompt with a safety\n",
      "preprompt, e.g., “You are a safe and responsible assistant,” and then fine-tuning the model on the safer\n",
      "responses without the preprompt, which essentially distills the safety preprompt (context) into the\n",
      "model. We use a targeted approach that allows our safety reward model to choose whether to use\n",
      "context distillation for each sample.\n",
      "4.2.1\n",
      "Safety Categories and Annotation Guidelines\n",
      "Based on limitations of LLMs known from prior work, we design instructions for our annotation team to\n",
      "create adversarial prompts along two dimensions: a risk category, or potential topic about which the LLM\n",
      "could produce unsafe content; and an attack vector, or question style to cover different varieties of prompts\n",
      "that could elicit bad model behaviors.\n",
      "The risk categories considered can be broadly divided into the following three categories: illicit and criminal\n",
      "activities (e.g., terrorism, theft, human trafficking); hateful and harmful activities (e.g., defamation, self-\n",
      "harm, eating disorders, discrimination); and unqualified advice (e.g., medical advice, financial advice, legal\n",
      "23\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "advice). The attack vectors explored consist of psychological manipulation (e.g., authority manipulation),\n",
      "logic manipulation (e.g., false premises), syntactic manipulation (e.g., misspelling), semantic manipulation\n",
      "(e.g., metaphor), perspective manipulation (e.g., role playing), non-English languages, and others.\n",
      "We then define best practices for safe and helpful model responses: the model should first address immediate\n",
      "safety concerns if applicable, then address the prompt by explaining the potential risks to the user, and finally\n",
      "provide additional information if possible. We also ask the annotators to avoid negative user experience\n",
      "categories (see Appendix A.5.2). The guidelines are meant to be a general guide for the model and are\n",
      "iteratively refined and revised to include newly identified risks.\n",
      "4.2.2\n",
      "Safety Supervised Fine-Tuning\n",
      "In accordance with the established guidelines from Section 4.2.1, we gather prompts and demonstrations\n",

      "manner as described in Section 3.1. An example can be found in Table 5.\n",
      "The annotators are instructed to initially come up with prompts that they think could potentially induce\n",

      "Safety RLHF\n",
      "We observe early in the development of Llama 2-Chat that it is able to generalize from the safe demonstrations\n",
      "in supervised fine-tuning. The model quickly learns to write detailed safe responses, address safety concerns,\n",
      "explain why the topic might be sensitive, and provide additional helpful information. In particular, when\n",
      "the model outputs safe responses, they are often more detailed than what the average annotator writes.\n",
      "Therefore, after gathering only a few thousand supervised demonstrations, we switched entirely to RLHF to\n",
      "teach the model how to write more nuanced responses. Comprehensive tuning with RLHF has the added\n",
      "benefit that it may make the model more robust to jailbreak attempts (Bai et al., 2022a).\n",
      "We conduct RLHF by first collecting human preference data for safety similar to Section 3.2.2: annotators\n",
      "write a prompt that they believe can elicit unsafe behavior, and then compare multiple model responses to\n",
      "the prompts, selecting the response that is safest according to a set of guidelines. We then use the human\n",

      "to refine initial generations to make them more useful, engaging, and unbiased (Ganguli et al., 2023; Madaan\n",

      "which models are prompted to explain their reasoning when given a complex problem, in order to increase\n",
      "the likelihood that their final answer is correct.\n",

      "Context Length.\n",
      "We expand the context window for Llama 2 from 2048 tokens to 4096 tokens. The longer\n",
      "context window enables models to process more information, which is particularly useful for supporting\n",
      "longer histories in chat applications, various summarization tasks, and understanding longer documents.\n",
      "Table 16 compares the performance of 2k and 4k context pretraining on long-context benchmarks. Both\n",
      "models are trained for 150B tokens, keeping the same architecture and hyperparameters as a baseline, varying\n",
      "only the context length. We observe improvement on SCROLLS (Shaham et al., 2022), where the average\n",
      "input length is 3.5k, and no performance degradation on SQUAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2018). Table 17 shows\n",
      "that the longer context model retains strong performance on various general-purpose tasks.\n",
      "Grouped-Query Attention.\n",
      "A standard practice for autoregressive decoding is to cache the key (K) and\n",
      "value (V) pairs for the previous tokens in the sequence, speeding up attention computation. With increasing\n",
      "context windows or batch sizes, however, the memory costs associated with the KV cache size in multi-head\n",
      "attention (MHA) models grow significantly. For larger models, where KV cache size becomes a bottleneck,\n",
      "key and value projections can be shared across multiple heads without much degradation of performance\n",
      "(Chowdhery et al., 2022). Either the original multi-query format with a single KV projection (MQA, Shazeer,\n",
      "2019) or a grouped-query attention variant with 8 KV projections (GQA, Ainslie et al., 2023) can be used.\n",
      "In Table 18, we compare MQA and GQA variants with an MHA baseline. We train all models with 150B\n",
      "tokens while keeping a fixed 30B model size. To keep a similar overall parameter count across GQA and\n",
      "MQA, we increase the dimension of the feed-forward layers to compensate for the reduction in the attention\n",
      "layers. For the MQA variant, we increase the FFN dimension by a factor of 1.33, and for the GQA variant, we\n",
      "increase it by a factor of 1.3. From the results, we observe that the GQA variant performs comparably to the\n",
      "MHA baseline on most evaluation tasks and is better than the MQA variant on average.\n",
      "To optimize for latency, we host our largest models using 8 A100s in a single node with tensor parallelism\n",
      "(Shoeybi et al., 2019). In this setting, sharding for MQA cannot be done across heads anymore, given the\n",
      "number of heads is lower than the number of GPUs. Either you duplicate the KV values in all GPUs (making\n",
      "the KV cache size equal to GQA), or an alternative is to shard across the batch dimension instead (Pope et al.,\n",
      "2022). The latter, however, can complicate an inference service, as it works only when batch sizes are larger\n",
      "than the number of shards and the additional communication cost is not worth it in all cases.\n",

      "Earlier work (Brown et al. (2020), Wei et al. (2022a), Du et al. (2022) in measuring such dataset contamination\n",
      "considered an example from an evaluation set to be “contaminated” if there existed a collision between\n",
      "a high-order n-gram (generally, n = 13) from the sample and the training data. This was a deliberately\n",
      "conservative approach in order to produce a “clean” subset of the data with high precision, and is used in\n",
      "open-sourced evaluation libraries (e.g. Gao et al. (2021)).\n",
      "This approach, however, was unable to detect precisely what proportion of a given sample is contaminated,\n",
      "and didn’t take into account how evaluation datasets are constructed. Furthermore, as noted in Chowdhery\n",
      "et al. (2022), some datasets (such as BoolQ) contain contexts extracted verbatim from the web, but not the\n",

      "scales, while retaining the ability to test a high-precision clean subset (samples with < 20% contamination)\n",
      "and a high-precision contaminated subset (samples with > 80% contamination). In order to account for the\n",
      "vagaries of the precise format of verbalized samples, we allow a small \"skipgram budget\" of four tokens, so\n",
      "that matched spans between an evaluation sample and the training data can differ in at most four positions\n",
      "(we do not allow trailing mismatches, or mismatches in the first 10 tokens).\n",
      "We identify such 10(+)-skipgrams with suffix arrays implemented using a variation of the library from Lee\n",
      "et al. (2022), modified to work on a PySpark cluster (effectively without random access to disk). Given the\n",
      "embarrassingly parallel nature of the task, we are able to find all such 10-grams (and their full lengths) in\n",
      "our entire dataset in around seven hours (including time to tokenize), utilizing an estimated 1,500 cores.\n",
      "As there are many confounding factors at play when determining whether dataset contamination has\n",

      "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise as highly capable AI assistants that excel in\n",
      "complex reasoning tasks requiring expert knowledge across a wide range of fields, including in specialized\n",
      "domains such as programming and creative writing. They enable interaction with humans through intuitive\n",

      "The capabilities of LLMs are remarkable considering the seemingly straightforward nature of the training\n",
      "methodology. Auto-regressive transformers are pretrained on an extensive corpus of self-supervised data,\n",
      "followed by alignment with human preferences via techniques such as Reinforcement Learning with Human\n",
      "Feedback (RLHF). Although the training methodology is simple, high computational requirements have\n",
      "limited the development of LLMs to a few players. There have been public releases of pretrained LLMs\n",
      "(such as BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022), LLaMa-1 (Touvron et al., 2023), and Falcon (Penedo et al., 2023)) that\n",
      "match the performance of closed pretrained competitors like GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) and Chinchilla\n",
      "(Hoffmann et al., 2022), but none of these models are suitable substitutes for closed “product” LLMs, such\n",
      "as ChatGPT, BARD, and Claude. These closed product LLMs are heavily fine-tuned to align with human\n",
      "preferences, which greatly enhances their usability and safety. This step can require significant costs in\n",
      "compute and human annotation, and is often not transparent or easily reproducible, limiting progress within\n",

      "In this work, we develop and release Llama 2, a family of pretrained and fine-tuned LLMs, Llama 2 and\n",
      "Llama 2-Chat, at scales up to 70B parameters. On the series of helpfulness and safety benchmarks we tested,\n",
      "Llama 2-Chat models generally perform better than existing open-source models. They also appear to\n",
