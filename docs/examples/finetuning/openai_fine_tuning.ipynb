Nagelkerken et\\xa0al., 2020).Therefore, \\n‘natural experiments’ from the geological past (Reddin et\\xa0al., 2020) provide insights into how food webs and their constituents respond to \\ncomplex change involving multiple drivers.Contemporary observations are occasionally long enough (>50\\xa0years) to capture community \\nresponses to complex climate change.For example, Brun et\\xa0al.(2019) reported a shift in zooplankton community structure in the North \\nAtlantic (1960–2014), with major biogeochemical ramifications.Conducting sufficiently long manipulation experiments to study the effect of adaptation on organisms is equally difficult (see Figure \\nBox\\xa03.1.1b), with much research restricted to multi-year studies of the microevolution of fast-growing (more than one division per day) \\nphytoplankton species responding to single drivers (Lohbeck et\\xa0al., 2012; Schaum et\\xa0al., 2016).In a few experimental evolution studies \\n(see (7) in Figure Box\\xa03.1.1a; Brennan et\\xa0al., 2017), multiple drivers have been used, but none have used communities or ecosystems (see \\nFigure Box\\xa03.1.1b).Nevertheless, the fossil record provides limited evidence of adaptations to less rapid (relative to present day) climate \\nchange (Jackson et\\xa0al., 2018).Despite the need to explore ecological or biogeochemical responses to projected future ocean conditions, \\nlogistical challenges require that assessments of climate-change impacts at scales larger than mesocosms use large-scale, long-term in \\nsitu observational studies (as documented in Section\\xa03.4).\\n\\npage_label: 409\\nfile_name: IPCC_AR6_WGII_Chapter03.pdf\\n\\n3\\n409Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Services  Chapter 3\\nunderlies inhibited thermal adaptation under nitrogen-limited \\nconditions (low confidence) (Aranguren-Gassis et\\xa0 al., 2019).When \\nselection is strong due to unfavourable environmental conditions, \\nmicrobial populations can encounter functional and evolutionary \\ntrade-offs evidenced by reducing growth rates while increasing \\ntolerance and metabolism of reactive oxygen species (Lindberg and \\nCollins, 2020).Other trade-offs can be observed in offspring quality \\nand number (Lindberg and Collins, 2020).These findings contribute \\ntowards a mechanistic framework describing the range of evolutionary \\nstrategies in response to multiple drivers (Collins et\\xa0al., 2020), but other \\nhazards, such as extreme events (e.g., MHWs), still need to be included \\nbecause their characteristics may alter the potential for adaptation of \\nspecies and populations to climate change (Gruber et\\xa0al., 2021).3.3.5 Ecological Response to Multiple Drivers\\nAssessing ecological responses to multiple climate-induced drivers \\nrequires a combination of approaches, including laboratory- and \\nfield-based experiments, field observations (e.g., natural gradients, \\nclimate analogues), study of paleo-analogues and the development \\nof mechanistic and empirical models (Clapham, 2019; Gissi et\\xa0 al., \\n2021).Experimental studies of food-web responses are often limited \\nto an individual driver, although recent manipulations have used a \\nmatrix of >1000-l mesocosms to explore ecological responses to both \\nwarming and acidification (see Box\\xa0 3.1; Nagelkerken et\\xa0 al., 2020).Hence, complementary approaches are needed to indirectly explore \\nthe mechanisms underlying ecosystem responses to global climate \\nchange (Parmesan et\\xa0al., 2013).Observations from time series longer \\nthan modes of natural variability (i.e., decades) are essential for \\nrevealing and attributing ecological responses to climate change (e.g., \\nSection\\xa03.4; Barton et\\xa0al., 2015b; Brun et\\xa0al., 2019).Also, paleorecords \\nprovide insights into the influence of multiple drivers on marine \\nbiota (Cross-Chapter Box\\xa0 PALEO in Chapter\\xa0 1; Reddin et\\xa0 al., 2020).Specifically, associations between vulnerabilities and traits of marine \\nectotherms in laboratory experiments correspond with organismal \\nresponses to ancient hyperthermal events (medium confidence) \\n(Reddin et\\xa0 al., 2020).This corroboration suggests that responses to \\nmultiple drivers inferred from the fossil record can help provide insights \\ninto the future status of functional groups, and hence food webs, under \\nrapid climate change.Multi-species and integrated end-to-end ecosystem models are \\npowerful tools to explore and project outcomes to the often-interacting \\ncumulative effects of climate change and other anthropogenic drivers \\n(Section\\xa03.1; Kaplan and Marshall, 2016; Koenigstein et\\xa0al., 2016; Peck \\nand Pinnegar, 2018; Tittensor et\\xa0 al., 2018; Gissi et\\xa0 al., 2021).These \\nmodels can integrate some aspects of the knowledge accrued from \\nmanipulation experiments, paleo- and contemporary observations, help \\ntest the relative importance of specific drivers and driver combinations, \\nand identify synergistic or antagonistic responses (Koenigstein et\\xa0al., \\n2016; Payne et\\xa0al., 2016; Skogen et\\xa0al., 2018; Tittensor et\\xa0al., 2018).As these models are associated with wide-ranging uncertainties \\n(SM3.2.2; Payne et\\xa0 al., 2016; Trolle et\\xa0 al., 2019; Heneghan et\\xa0 al., \\n2021), they cannot be expected to accurately project the trajectories \\nof complex marine ecosystems under climate change; hence, they are \\nmost useful for assessing overall trends and in particular for providing a plausible envelope of trajectories across a range of assumptions \\n(Fulton et\\xa0al., 2018; Peck et\\xa0al., 2018; Tittensor et\\xa0al., 2018).\\n---------------------\\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\\nQuery: What are some approaches used to assess ecological responses to multiple climate-induced drivers in the context of climate change and the oceans?\\nAnswer: '}\n",
      "{'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Several approaches are used to assess ecological responses to multiple climate-induced drivers.

Paleorecords also provide insights into the influence of multiple drivers on marine biota. Multi-species and integrated end-to-end ecosystem models are powerful tools to explore and project outcomes to the often-interacting cumulative effects of climate change and other anthropogenic drivers. These models can integrate some aspects of the knowledge accrued from manipulation experiments, paleo- and contemporary observations, help test the relative importance of specific drivers and driver combinations, and identify synergistic or antagonistic responses.'}\n",
