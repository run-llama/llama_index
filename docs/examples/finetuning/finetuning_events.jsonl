Nagelkerken et\u00a0al., 2020).Therefore, \n\u2018natural experiments\u2019 from the geological past (Reddin et\u00a0al., 2020) provide insights into how food webs and their constituents respond to \ncomplex change involving multiple drivers.Contemporary observations are occasionally long enough (>50\u00a0years) to capture community \nresponses to complex climate change.For example, Brun et\u00a0al.(2019) reported a shift in zooplankton community structure in the North \nAtlantic (1960\u20132014), with major biogeochemical ramifications.Conducting sufficiently long manipulation experiments to study the effect of adaptation on organisms is equally difficult (see Figure \nBox\u00a03.1.1b), with much research restricted to multi-year studies of the microevolution of fast-growing (more than one division per day) \nphytoplankton species responding to single drivers (Lohbeck et\u00a0al., 2012; Schaum et\u00a0al., 2016).In a few experimental evolution studies \n(see (7) in Figure Box\u00a03.1.1a; Brennan et\u00a0al., 2017), multiple drivers have been used, but none have used communities or ecosystems (see \nFigure Box\u00a03.1.1b).Nevertheless, the fossil record provides limited evidence of adaptations to less rapid (relative to present day) climate \nchange (Jackson et\u00a0al., 2018).Despite the need to explore ecological or biogeochemical responses to projected future ocean conditions, \nlogistical challenges require that assessments of climate-change impacts at scales larger than mesocosms use large-scale, long-term in \nsitu observational studies (as documented in Section\u00a03.4).\n\npage_label: 409\nfile_name: IPCC_AR6_WGII_Chapter03.pdf\n\n3\n409Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Services  Chapter 3\nunderlies inhibited thermal adaptation under nitrogen-limited \nconditions (low confidence) (Aranguren-Gassis et\u00a0 al., 2019).When \nselection is strong due to unfavourable environmental conditions, \nmicrobial populations can encounter functional and evolutionary \ntrade-offs evidenced by reducing growth rates while increasing \ntolerance and metabolism of reactive oxygen species (Lindberg and \nCollins, 2020).Other trade-offs can be observed in offspring quality \nand number (Lindberg and Collins, 2020).These findings contribute \ntowards a mechanistic framework describing the range of evolutionary \nstrategies in response to multiple drivers (Collins et\u00a0al., 2020), but other \nhazards, such as extreme events (e.g., MHWs), still need to be included \nbecause their characteristics may alter the potential for adaptation of \nspecies and populations to climate change (Gruber et\u00a0al., 2021).3.3.5 Ecological Response to Multiple Drivers\nAssessing ecological responses to multiple climate-induced drivers \nrequires a combination of approaches, including laboratory- and \nfield-based experiments, field observations (e.g., natural gradients, \nclimate analogues), study of paleo-analogues and the development \nof mechanistic and empirical models (Clapham, 2019; Gissi et\u00a0 al., \n2021).Experimental studies of food-web responses are often limited \nto an individual driver, although recent manipulations have used a \nmatrix of >1000-l mesocosms to explore ecological responses to both \nwarming and acidification (see Box\u00a0 3.1; Nagelkerken et\u00a0 al., 2020).Hence, complementary approaches are needed to indirectly explore \nthe mechanisms underlying ecosystem responses to global climate \nchange (Parmesan et\u00a0al., 2013).Observations from time series longer \nthan modes of natural variability (i.e., decades) are essential for \nrevealing and attributing ecological responses to climate change (e.g., \nSection\u00a03.4; Barton et\u00a0al., 2015b; Brun et\u00a0al., 2019).Also, paleorecords \nprovide insights into the influence of multiple drivers on marine \nbiota (Cross-Chapter Box\u00a0 PALEO in Chapter\u00a0 1; Reddin et\u00a0 al., 2020).Specifically, associations between vulnerabilities and traits of marine \nectotherms in laboratory experiments correspond with organismal \nresponses to ancient hyperthermal events (medium confidence) \n(Reddin et\u00a0 al., 2020).This corroboration suggests that responses to \nmultiple drivers inferred from the fossil record can help provide insights \ninto the future status of functional groups, and hence food webs, under \nrapid climate change.Multi-species and integrated end-to-end ecosystem models are \npowerful tools to explore and project outcomes to the often-interacting \ncumulative effects of climate change and other anthropogenic drivers \n(Section\u00a03.1; Kaplan and Marshall, 2016; Koenigstein et\u00a0al., 2016; Peck \nand Pinnegar, 2018; Tittensor et\u00a0 al., 2018; Gissi et\u00a0 al., 2021).These \nmodels can integrate some aspects of the knowledge accrued from \nmanipulation experiments, paleo- and contemporary observations, help \ntest the relative importance of specific drivers and driver combinations, \nand identify synergistic or antagonistic responses (Koenigstein et\u00a0al., \n2016; Payne et\u00a0al., 2016; Skogen et\u00a0al., 2018; Tittensor et\u00a0al., 2018).As these models are associated with wide-ranging uncertainties \n(SM3.2.2; Payne et\u00a0 al., 2016; Trolle et\u00a0 al., 2019; Heneghan et\u00a0 al., \n2021), they cannot be expected to accurately project the trajectories \nof complex marine ecosystems under climate change; hence, they are \nmost useful for assessing overall trends and in particular for providing a plausible envelope of trajectories across a range of assumptions \n(Fulton et\u00a0al., 2018; Peck et\u00a0al., 2018; Tittensor et\u00a0al., 2018).\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: What are some approaches used to assess ecological responses to multiple climate-induced drivers in the context of climate change and the oceans?\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Several approaches are used to assess ecological responses to multiple climate-induced drivers. These include laboratory- and field-based experiments, field observations such as natural gradients and climate analogues, the study of paleo-analogues, and the development of mechanistic and empirical models. Experimental studies often focus on individual drivers, but recent manipulations have used large-volume mesocosms to explore ecological responses to both warming and acidification. Observations from time series longer than modes of natural variability are essential for revealing and attributing ecological responses to climate change. Paleorecords also provide insights into the influence of multiple drivers on marine biota. Multi-species and integrated end-to-end ecosystem models are powerful tools to explore and project outcomes to the often-interacting cumulative effects of climate change and other anthropogenic drivers. These models can integrate some aspects of the knowledge accrued from manipulation experiments, paleo- and contemporary observations, help test the relative importance of specific drivers and driver combinations, and identify synergistic or antagonistic responses."}]}

Tittensor \net\u00a0 al., 2021).Biological interactions may exacerbate or buffer the \nprojected impacts.For instance, trophic amplification (strengthening \nof responses to climate-induced drivers at higher trophic levels) may \nresult from combined direct and indirect food-web-mediated effects \n(medium confidence) (Section\u00a03.4.3.4; Lotze et\u00a0al., 2019).Alternatively, \ncompensatory species interactions can dampen strong impacts on \nspecies from ocean acidification, resulting in weaker responses at \nfunctional-group or community level than at species level (medium \nconfidence) (Marshall et\u00a0al., 2017; Hoppe et\u00a0al., 2018b; Olsen et\u00a0al., \n2018; Gissi et\u00a0al., 2021).Globally, the projected reduction of biomass \ndue to climate-induced drivers is relatively unaffected by fishing \npressure, indicating additive responses of fisheries and climate change \n(low confidence) (Lotze et\u00a0al., 2019).Regionally, projected interactions \nof climate-induced drivers, fisheries and other regional non-climate \ndrivers can be both synergistic and antagonistic, varying across regions, \nfunctional groups and species, and can cause nonlinear dynamics with \ncounterintuitive outcomes, underlining the importance of adaptations \nand associated trade-offs (high confidence) (Sections\u00a03.5.3, 3.6.3.1.2, \n4.5, 4.6; Weijerman et\u00a0al., 2015; Fulton et\u00a0al., 2018; Hansen et\u00a0al., 2019; \nTrolle et\u00a0al., 2019; Zeng et\u00a0al., 2019; Holsman et\u00a0al., 2020; Pethybridge \net\u00a0al., 2020; Gissi et\u00a0al., 2021).Given the limitations of individual ecological models discussed above, \nmodel intercomparisons, such as the Fisheries and Marine Ecosystem \nModel Intercomparison Project (Fish-MIP; Tittensor et\u00a0al., 2018) show \npromise in increasing the robustness of projected ecological outcomes \n(Tittensor et\u00a0 al., 2018).Model ensembles include a greater number \nof relevant processes and functional groups than any single model \nand thus capture a wider range of plausible responses.Among the \nglobal Fish-MIP models, there is high (temperate and tropical areas) \nto medium agreement (coastal and polar regions) on the direction of \nchange, but medium (temperate and tropical regions) to low agreement \n(coastal and polar regions) on magnitude of change (Lotze et\u00a0al., 2019; \nHeneghan et\u00a0al., 2021).Although model outputs are validated relative \nto observations to assess model skills (Payne et\u00a0 al., 2016; Tittensor \net\u00a0 al., 2018), the Fish-MIP models under-represent some sources of \nuncertainty, as they often do not include parameter uncertainties and \ndo not usually include impacts of ocean acidification, oxygen loss \nor evolutionary responses because there remains high uncertainty \nregarding the influences of these processes across functional groups.Ensemble model investigations like Fish-MIP have also identified gaps \nin our mechanistic understanding of ecosystems and their responses \nto anthropogenic forcing, leading to model improvement and more \nrigorous benchmarking.These investigations could inspire future \ntargeted observational and experimental research to test the validity \nof model assumptions (Payne et\u00a0al., 2016;

Harper et\u00a0 al., 2020b; Michalena et\u00a0 al., 2020).Targeted \nefforts to incorporate knowledge diversity, and include artisanal \nfishers, women and Indigenous Peoples within international, regional \nand local policy planning, promote marine adaptation that supports \nachievement of gender equality (SDG5) and reduces inequalities \n(SDG10) (limited evidence, high agreement) (FAO, 2015).Integrated \nplanning, financing and implementation can help overcome these \nlimitations (Section\u00a0 3.6.3.3.2; Cross-Chapter\u00a0 Box\u00a0 FINANCE in \nChapter\u00a0 17), ensuring that marine adaptations do not compromise \noverall human equity or specific SDGs (\u00d6sterblom et\u00a0al., 2020; Nash \net\u00a0al., 2021), but are in fact fully synergistic with these goals (Bennett \net\u00a0al., 2021).3.6.4.3 Relevant Policy Frameworks for Ocean Adaptation\nThe intricacy, scope, time scales and uncertainties associated with \nclimate change challenge ocean governance, which already is \nextremely complex because it encompasses a variety of overlapping \nspatial scales, concerns and governance structures (see Figure\u00a0CB3.1 in \nSROCC Chapter\u00a01; Prakash et\u00a0al., 2019).Assessment of how established \nglobal agreements and regional, sectoral or scientific bodies address \nclimate adaptation and resilience, and how current practices can be \nimproved, is found in SM3.5.3.There is growing momentum to include the ocean in international \nclimate policy (robust evidence), paving the way for a more integrated approach to both mitigation and adaptation.Following adoption of \nthe Paris Agreement in 2015, the UN SDGs (Table\u00a0 3.31) came into \nforce in 2016, including SDG14 specifically dedicated to Life Below \nWater (Table\u00a03.31).In 2017, the first UN Ocean Conference was held \n(United Nations, 2017), the UNFCCC adopted the Ocean Pathway to \nincrease ocean-targeted multilateral climate action (COP23, 2017) \nand the UN Assembly declared 2021\u20132030 the Decade for Ocean \nScience for Sustainable Development (Visbeck, 2018; Lee et\u00a0al., 2020).Next, 14 world leaders formed the High-Level Panel for a Sustainable \nOcean Economy to produce the New Ocean Action Agenda, founded \non 100% sustainable management of national ocean spaces by 2025 \n(Ocean Panel, 2020).All of these initiatives position oceans centrally \nwithin the climate-policy and biodiversity-conservation landscapes \nand seek to develop a coherent effort and common frameworks to \nachieve marine sustainability (Visbeck, 2018; Lee et\u00a0 al., 2020), new \neconomic opportunities (Konar and Ding, 2020; Lee et\u00a0al., 2020), more \nequitable outcomes (\u00d6sterblom et\u00a0 al., 2020) and decisive climate \nmitigation and adaptation (Hoegh-Guldberg et\u00a0al., 2019a), to achieve \ntruly transformative change (Claudet et\u00a0al., 2020a).There is high confidence in the literature that multilateral environmental \nagreements need better alignment and integration to support \nachievement of ambitious international development, climate mitigation \nand adaptation goals (Swilling et\u00a0al., 202; Duarte et\u00a0al., 2020; Friedman \net\u00a0al., 2020; Conservation International and IUCN, 2021; P\u00f6rtner et\u00a0al., \n2021b; Sumaila et\u00a0al., 2021).The ocean targets of the CBD (e.g., the Post-\n2020 Global Biodiversity Framework), the SDGs (Agenda 2030) and the \nParis Agreement are already inclusive and synergistic (Duarte et\u00a0al., 2020).\n\npage_label: 489\nfile_name: IPCC_AR6_WGII_Chapter03.pdf\n\nOcean renewable-energy expansion faces other technological \nobstacles including lack of implementable or scalable energy-capture \ndevices, access to offshore sites, competing coastal uses, potential environmental impacts and lack of power-grid infrastructure at the \ncoast (Aderinto and Li, 2018; Neill et\u00a0al., 2018).3.6.4 Contribution to the Sustainable Development \nGoals and Other Relevant Policy Frameworks\nThe impacts of climate change on ocean and coastal ecosystems and \ntheir services threaten achievement of the UN SDGs by 2030 (high \nconfidence), particularly ocean targets (Table\u00a03.31; Nilsson et\u00a0al., 2016; \nPecl et\u00a0al., 2017; IPCC, 2018; Singh et\u00a0al., 2019a; Claudet et\u00a0al., 2020a).Nevertheless, local to international decision-making bodies have \nassigned the lowest priority to SDG14, Life Below Water (Nash et\u00a0al., \n2020).3.6.4.1 Climate Mitigation Effects on Ocean-Related SDGs\nSROCC underscored the need for ambitious mitigation to control \nclimate hazards in the ocean to achieve SDGs (medium evidence, high \nagreement) (Bindoff et\u00a0al., 2019a; Oppenheimer et\u00a0al., 2019).Delays in \nachieving ocean-dependent SDGs observed in SROCC and SR15 can be \naddressed with ambitious planned adaptation and mitigation action \n(high agreement) (Hoegh-Guldberg et\u00a0al., 2019b).Since the ocean can \ncontribute substantially to the attainment of mitigation targets aiming \nto limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels (Hoegh-Guldberg \net\u00a0al., 2019b), and to adaptation solutions facilitating attainment of \nsocial and economic SDGs, climate policy is treating the ocean less as \na victim of climate change and more as a central participant in solving \nthe global climate challenge (Cooley et\u00a0 al., 2019; Hoegh-Guldberg \net\u00a0al., 2019a; Dundas et\u00a0al., 2020).Relationships between Climate Action (SDG13) targets and SDG14 \ntargets are mostly synergistic (Figure\u00a0 3.26; Fuso Nerini et\u00a0 al., 2019).Responding to climate-change impacts requires transformative \ngovernance (high confidence) (Chapters\u00a0 1, 18; Collins et\u00a0 al., 2019a; \nBrodie Rudolph et\u00a0al., 2020; Claudet et\u00a0al., 2020a), especially for extreme \nevents and higher-impact scenarios (e.g., higher emissions) (Fedele et\u00a0al., \n2019), and for achieving SDGs through one of the global ecosystems \ntransitions (Chapter\u00a018; Sachs et\u00a0al., 2019; Brodie Rudolph et\u00a0al., 2020).Opportunities to transform ocean governance exist in developing new \ninternational and local agreements, regulations and policies that reduce \nthe risks of relocating ocean and coastal activities (Section\u00a03.6.3.1.1) \nor in reinventing established practices (Section\u00a0 3.6.3.3.3).Policy \ntransformations improving ocean sustainability under SDG14 also help \naddress SDG13 (Brodie Rudolph et\u00a0al., 2020;\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: What are some of the global initiatives and frameworks that aim to integrate the ocean into climate policy and achieve marine sustainability?\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Several global initiatives and frameworks aim to integrate the ocean into climate policy and achieve marine sustainability.

Warmer oceans and reduced sea ice have led to increased primary production in the Arctic, although the trends are less clear in the Antarctic. These changes have also influenced key mechanisms determining energy transfer between trophic levels, such as altered size spectra, shifts in trophic pathways, phenological mismatches, and increased top-down trophic regulation. \n\nMajor community shifts have been observed in polar oceans in response to warming trends. In the Arctic, the abundances and ranges of fish species are declining and contracting, while the ranges of boreal fish species are expanding. The extreme seasonal solar radiation cycles of these high latitudes may act as a barrier for species immigration and change predator\u2013prey dynamics in previously ice-covered areas. \n\nMarine mammals and birds have shown both positive and negative responses to these changes, with observed changes in their behavior, physiology, and distribution, especially due to loss of sea ice. Reproductive failures and declining abundances have been observed in populations of polar bears, seals, whales, and marine birds due to warmer polar oceans and less sea ice cover. \n\nThe ongoing changes can lead to temporary increases in biodiversity and functional diversity, but also reduced trophic-transfer efficiencies and functional redundancy, with uncertain consequences for ecosystem resilience and vulnerability. Calcareous polar organisms are among the groups most sensitive to ocean acidification."}]}

Which industries and jobs are most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change in the oceans?The global ocean underpins human well-being through the provision of resources that directly and indirectly feed and employ many millions \nof people.In many regions, climate change is degrading ocean health and altering stocks of marine resources.Together with over-harvesting, \nclimate change is threatening the future of the sustenance provided to Indigenous Peoples, the livelihoods of artisanal fisheries, and \nmarine-based industries including tourism, shipping and transportation.The ocean is the lifeblood of the planet.In addition to regulating planetary cycles of carbon, water and heat, \nthe ocean and its vast resources support human livelihoods, cultural practices, jobs and industries.The impacts \nof climate change on the ocean can influence human activities and employment by altering resource availability, \nspreading pathogens, flooding shorelines and degrading ocean ecosystems.Fishing and mariculture are highly \nexposed to change.The global ocean and inland waters together provide more than 3.3\u00a0billion people at least \n20% of the protein they eat and provide livelihoods for 60\u00a0million people.Changes in the nutritional quality or \nabundance of food from the oceans could influence billions of people.Substantial economic losses for fisheries resulting from recent climate-driven harmful algal blooms and marine \npathogen outbreaks have been recorded in Asia, North America and South America.A 2016 event in Chile caused \nan estimated loss of 800\u00a0million USD in the farmed-salmon industry and led to regional government protests.The \nrecent closure of the Dungeness crab and razor clam fishery in the USA due to a climate-driven algal bloom harmed \n84% of surveyed residents from 16 California coastal communities.Fishers and service industries that support \ncommercial and recreational fishing experienced the most substantial economic losses, and fishers were the least \nable to recover their losses.This same event also disrupted subsistence and recreational fishing for razor clams, \nimportant activities for Indigenous Peoples and local communities in the Pacific Northwest of the USA.Other goods from the ocean, including non-food products like dietary supplements, food preservatives, pharmaceuticals, \nbiofuels, sponges and cosmetic products, as well as luxury products like jewellery coral, cultured pearls and aquarium \nspecies, will change in abundance or quality due to climate change.For instance, ocean warming is endangering the \n\u2018candlefish\u2019 ooligan (Thaleichthys pacificus), whose oil is a traditional food source and medicine of Indigenous Peoples \nof the Pacific Northwest of North America.Declines in tourism and real estate values, associated with climate-driven \nharmful algal blooms, have also been recorded in the USA, France and England.Small-scale fisheries livelihoods and jobs are the most vulnerable to climate-driven changes in marine resources and \necosystem services.The abundance and composition of their harvest depend on suitable environmental conditions and \non IKLK developed over generations.Large-scale fisheries, though still vulnerable, are more able to adapt to climate \nchange due to greater mobility and greater resources for changing technologies.These fisheries are already adapting \nby broadening catch diversity, increasing their mobility to follow shifting species, and changing gear, technology and \nstrategies.Adaptation in large-scale fisheries, however, is at times constrained by regulations and governance challenges.Jobs, industries and livelihoods which depend on particular species or are tied to the coast can also be at risk from \nclimate change.Species-dependent livelihoods (e.g., a lobster fishery or oyster farm) are vulnerable due to a lack \nof substitutes if the fished species are declining, biodiversity is reduced, or mariculture is threatened by climate \nchange or ocean acidification.Coastal activities and industries ranging from fishing (e.g., gleaning on a tidal flat) \nto tourism to shipping and transportation are also vulnerable to sea level rise and other climate-change impacts on \nthe coastal environment.The ability of coastal systems to protect the shoreline will decline due to sea level rise and \nsimultaneous degradation of nearshore systems, including coral reefs, kelp forests and coastal wetlands.The vulnerability of communities to losses in marine ecosystem services varies within and among communities.Tourists seeking to replace lost cultural services can adapt by engaging in the activity elsewhere.But communities \nwho depend on tourism for income or who have strong cultural identity linked to the ocean have a more \ndifficult time.\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: What are some of the impacts of

for example, the accumulated heat stress above typical summer temperatures, \ndescribed by \u2018degree heating weeks\u2019, is used to estimate the likelihood of coral bleaching.Over the past century, MHWs have doubled in frequency, become more intense, lasted for longer and extended \nover larger areas.Marine heatwaves have occurred in every ocean region over the past few decades, most markedly \nin association with regional climate phenomena such as the El Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation.During the 2015\u20132016 El \nNi\u00f1o event, 70% of the world\u2019s ocean surface encountered MHWs.Such MHWs cause mortality of a wide variety of marine species, from corals to kelp to seagrasses to fish to seabirds, \nand they have consequent effects on ecosystems and industries such as mariculture and fisheries.Warm-water coral \nreefs, estuarine seagrass meadows and cold-temperate kelp forests are among the ecosystems most threatened by \nMHWs since they are attached to the seafloor (see FAQ 3.2).Unusually warm temperatures cause bleaching and \nassociated death of warm-water corals, which can lead to shifts to low-diversity or algae-dominated reefs, changes \nin fish communities and deterioration of the physical reef structure, which causes habitat loss and increases the \nvulnerability of nearby shorelines to large-wave events and SLR.Since the early 1980s, the frequency and severity \nof mass coral bleaching events have increased sharply worldwide.For example, from 2016 through 2020, the Great \nBarrier Reef experienced mass coral bleaching three times in 5\u00a0years.Mass loss of kelp from MHWs effects on the canopy-forming species has occurred across ocean basins, including \nthe coasts of Japan, Canada, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand.In southern Norway and the northeast USA, \nmortality from MHWs contributed to the decline of sugar kelp over the past two decades and the spread of turf \nalgal ecosystems that prevent recolonisation by the original canopy-forming species.One of the largest and longest-duration MHWs, nicknamed the \u2018Blob\u2019, occurred in the Northeast Pacific Ocean, \nextending from California north towards the Bering Sea, from 2013 through 2015.Warming from the MHW persisted \ninto 2016 off the West Coast of the USA and into 2018 in the deeper waters of a Canadian fjord.The consequent \neffects of this expansive MHW included widespread shifts in abundance, distribution and nutritional value of \ninvertebrates and fish, a bloom of toxic algae off the West Coast of the USA that impacted fisheries, the decline of \nCalifornia kelp forests that contributed to the collapse of the abalone fishery, and mass mortality of seabirds.The projected increase in the frequency, severity, duration and areal extent of MHWs threaten many marine species \nand ecosystems.\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: What are the impacts of marine heatwaves on species and ecosystems, according to the provided context?\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Marine heatwaves (MHWs) have a significant impact on a wide variety of marine species and ecosystems.

These events can lead to shifts in species populations, with original inhabitants decreasing and new species invading. They can also cause harmful algae blooms and changes in the ecosystem structure. \n\nFor example, unusually warm temperatures can cause bleaching and associated death of warm-water corals, leading to shifts to low-diversity or algae-dominated reefs, changes in fish communities, and deterioration of the physical reef structure. This causes habitat loss and increases the vulnerability of nearby shorelines to large-wave events. \n\nMHWs have also contributed to the mass loss of kelp across various ocean basins, including the coasts of Japan, Canada, Mexico, Australia, and New Zealand.

Barton et\u00a0al., 2015a).Laboratory studies show \nthat ocean acidification decreases the fitness, growth or survival of \nmany economically and culturally important larval or juvenile shelled \nmollusks (high confidence) (Cao et\u00a0 al., 2018; Onitsuka et\u00a0 al., 2018; \nStevens and Gobler, 2018; Griffith et\u00a0al., 2019a; Mellado et\u00a0al., 2019) \nand of several valuable wild-harvest crab species (Barton et\u00a0al., 2015a; \nPunt et\u00a0al., 2015;

Espinel-\nVelasco et\u00a0al., 2018), suggesting possible changes in fish survival and \nthus fishery characteristics.Deoxygenation can decrease size and \nabundance of marine species and suppress trophic interactions (Levin, \n2003), decrease the diversity within marine ecosystems (Sperling et\u00a0al., \n2016) while temporarily increasing catchability and increasing the risk \nof overfishing (Breitburg et\u00a0 al., 2018) and decrease the ecosystem \nservices provided by specific fisheries (Orio et\u00a0al., 2021).The chronic \neffects of deoxygenation on wild fisheries are complex and highly \ninteractive with co-occurring drivers and overall ecosystem responses \n(medium evidence, high agreement) (Townhill et\u00a0al., 2017; Rose et\u00a0al., \n2019).Detecting and attributing marine ecosystem responses to \nocean acidification and deoxygenation outside of laboratory studies \nremains challenging because of the strong influence of co-occurring \nenvironmental changes on natural systems (Section\u00a03.3.5; Rose et\u00a0al., \n2019; Doo et\u00a0al., 2020).Ocean and coastal organisms will continue moving poleward under \nRCP8.5 (high confidence) (Section\u00a03.4.3.1.3; Figure\u00a03.18), and this is \nexpected to decrease fisheries harvests in low latitudes and alter species \ncomposition and abundance in higher latitudes (high confidence) \n(Table\u00a03.26; Figure\u00a03.23; Asch et\u00a0al., 2018; Morley et\u00a0al., 2018; Tai et\u00a0al., \n2019; Erauskin-Extramiana et\u00a0al., 2020; Shelton et\u00a0al., 2021).Species \nthat succeed in new ranges or conditions may offer opportunities to \ndiversify regional fisheries or aquaculture (Sections\u00a0 3.6.3.1.2, 5.8.4, \n5.9.4; Bindoff et\u00a0 al., 2019a), or they may outcompete indigenous \nspecies and act as invasive species (Sections\u00a03.4.2.10, 3.5.2).Temperature will continue to be a major driver of fisheries changes \nglobally, but other non-climate factors like organism physiology and \necosystem response (Section\u00a03.3) and fishing pressure (Chapter\u00a05), as \nwell as other climate-induced drivers like acidification, deoxygenation \nand sea ice loss (Section\u00a03.2), will play critical roles in future global \nand local fisheries changes (high confidence).Warming, acidification \nand business-as-usual fishing policy under RCP8.5 are projected \nto place around 60% of global fisheries at very high risk (medium \nconfidence) (Cheung et\u00a0 al., 2018).Model intercomparison showed \nthat ocean acidification and protection affect ecosystems more than \nfishing pressure, and ecological adaptation will significantly determine \nimpacts on fishery biomass, catch and value until approximately 2050 \n(medium confidence) (Olsen et\u00a0 al., 2018).Ecosystem responses to \nwarming water, fishing pressure, food-web changes, MHWs and sea \nice algal populations have been responsible for highly variable or \ncollapsing populations of Northern Hemisphere high-latitude forage \nfish species including sand lances (Ammodytes spp.\n\npage_label: 431\nfile_name: IPCC_AR6_WGII_Chapter03.pdf\n\n(2021) reports that >80% of sampled sea snail, Limacina helicina, a key \nspecies in pelagic food webs, displayed signs of shell dissolution in the \nAmundsen Gulf.However, bacteria, phytoplankton, zooplankton and \nbenthic communities are found to be detrimentally impacted, resilient \nor even positively influenced by ocean acidification in observational\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: Question: According to the provided context, which study investigated the impact of ocean acidification on herring larvae survival?\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The context does not provide information on a specific study investigating the impact of ocean acidification on herring larvae survival."}]}

Cattano et\u00a0al., 2018; Calder\u00f3n-Li\u00e9vanos et\u00a0al., 2019; Schwieterman et\u00a0al., 2019).Warming and hypoxia \nare mostly positively correlated and tolerances to both phenomena \nare often linked after long-term acclimation (e.g., Bouyoucos et\u00a0 al., \n2020).Acute short-term heat shocks can impair hypoxia tolerance, \nfor instance, in intertidal fish (McArley et\u00a0al., 2020).This is relevant \nfor shallow waters, specifically for MHWs (Section\u00a0 3.2.2.1; Hobday \net\u00a0al., 2016a; IPCC, 2018; Collins et\u00a0al., 2019a).Ocean acidification can \nincrease hypoxia tolerance in some cases, possibly by downregulating \nactivity (Faleiro et\u00a0 al., 2015) and/or changing blood oxygenation \n(Montgomery et\u00a0al., 2019).Other studies, however, reported additive \nnegative effects of acidification and warming on hypoxia tolerance \n(Schwieterman et\u00a0al., 2019; G\u00f6tze et\u00a0al., 2020), in line with the oxygen- \nand capacity-limited thermal tolerance (OCLTT) hypothesis presented \nin AR5 (P\u00f6rtner et\u00a0 al., 2014): Warming causes increased metabolic \nrates and oxygen demand in ectotherms, which at some point exceed \nsupply capacities (which also depend on environmental oxygen \navailability) and reduce aerobic scope.In consequence, expansion of \nOMZs and other regions where warming, hypoxia and acidification \ncombine will further reduce habitat for many fish and invertebrates \n(high confidence) (Sections\u00a03.4.3.2, 3.4.3.3).Food availability modulates, and may be more influential than, \nother driver responses by affecting the energetic and nutritional \nstatus of animals (Cole et\u00a0 al., 2016; Stiasny et\u00a0 al., 2019; Cominassi \net\u00a0al., 2020).Laboratory studies conducted under an excess of food \nrisk underestimating the ecological effects of climate-induced \ndrivers, because increased feeding rates may help mitigate adverse \neffects (Nowicki et\u00a0 al., 2012; Towle et\u00a0 al., 2015; Cominassi et\u00a0 al., \n2020).Lowered food availability from reduced open-ocean primary \nproduction (Sections\u00a03.2.3.3, 3.4.4.2.1) will act as an additional driver, \namplifying the detrimental effects of other drivers.However, warming \nand higher CO 2 availability may increase primary productivity in some \ncoastal areas (Section\u00a03.4.4.1), ameliorating the adverse direct effects \non animals (e.g., Sswat et\u00a0al., 2018).Due to the few studies addressing \nfood availability under multiple-driver scenarios (Thomsen et\u00a0al., 2013; \nPistevos et\u00a0al., 2015; Towle et\u00a0al., 2015; Ramajo et\u00a0al., 2016; Brown \net\u00a0al., 2018a; Cominassi et\u00a0al., 2020), there is medium confidence in its \nmodulating effect on climate-induced driver responses.Animal behaviour can be affected by ocean acidification, warming \nand hypoxia.While warming and hypoxia mostly induce avoidance \nbehaviour, potentially leading to migration and habitat compression \n(Section\u00a03.4; McCormick and Levin, 2017; Limburg et\u00a0al., 2020), the \neffects of acidification appear more complex.Some studies reported \nthat acidification dominates behavioural effects (Schmidt et\u00a0al., 2017), \nalthough outcomes vary with experimental design and duration \nof exposure (low confidence, low agreement) (Maximino and de \nBrito, 2010; Munday et\u00a0 al., 2016; Laubenstein et\u00a0 al., 2018; Munday \net\u00a0 al., 2019; Sundin et\u00a0 al., 2019; Clark et\u00a0 al., 2020; Munday et\u00a0 al., \n2020; Williamson et\u00a0 al., 2021).Behaviour represents an integrated \nphenomenon that can be influenced both directly and indirectly \nby multiple drivers.\n\npage_label: 414\nfile_name: IPCC_AR6_WGII_Chapter03.pdf\n\nNet calcification and abundance of mussels and other \nfoundational species, including oysters, are expected to decline due to \nocean acidification (very high confidence) (Kwiatkowski et\u00a0al., 2016;

Their long generation times and slow population \ngrowth suggests limited evolutionary resilience to rapid climate change (Section\u00a03.3.4; Sydeman et\u00a0al., 2015; Miller et\u00a0al., 2018). According \nto the Red List Species Assessments of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN, 2020), the greatest current hazards to \nthese groups include human use of biological resources and areas, invasive species and pollution (see Figure\u00a0Box\u00a03.2.1; Dias et\u00a0al., 2019; \nLusseau et\u00a0al., 2021). Impacts of climate change and severe weather are ranked among the five most-important hazards influencing \n131 and 45 bird and mammal species, respectively (see Figure\u00a0Box\u00a03.2.1 for selection of species), including 24 bird and 7 mammal \nspecies that are currently listed as endangered, critically endangered or threatened. Furthermore, according to these IUCN assessments, \nclimate change and severe weather are expected to impact an additional 122 and 18 marine bird and mammal species over the next \n50\u2013100\u00a0years, respectively (see Figure\u00a0Box\u00a03.2.1; Dias et\u00a0al., 2019).\n0Hazard assessment for marine birds and mammals\n(a) Number of marine bird species\nResidential\nand\ncommercial\ndevelopmentAgriculture\nand\naquacultureEnergy\nproduction\nand miningTransportation \nand service\ncorridorsBiological\nresource\nuseHuman\nintrusions\nand\ndisturbanceNatural\nsystem\nmodificationsInvasive\nand other\nproblematic\nspecies, genes\nand diseasesPollution Geological\neventsClimate\nchange\nand\nsevere\nweatherOther\noptions050100150200250300350\n120\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20(b) Number of marine mammal speciesAdditional species expected to be exposed to these threats over the next 50\u2013100 years Species currently impacted by different hazards\nFigure\u00a0Box\u00a03.2.1 | \u00a0Hazard assessment for marine birds and mammals. Number of (a) marine birds and (b) mammals currently impacted by different hazards \n(blue), and numbers of additional species expected to be exposed to these threats over the next 50\u2013100\u00a0years (red), as assessed in the International Union for Conservation \nof Nature Red List (IUCN, 2020). Seabird species include species in the key orders Sphenisciformes, Pelecaniformes, Suliformes, Anseriformes, Procellariiformes and \nCharadriiformes categorised as inhabitants of marine ecosystems (n = 483 species, assessed in the period 2016\u20132019). Marine mammal species include the species \nreviewed by Lusseau et\u00a0al. (2021) (n = 136 species, assessed in the period 2008\u20132019).\nMarine birds and mammals are vulnerable to climate-induced loss of breeding and foraging habitats such as sea ice (Section\u00a03.4.2.12), \nsandy beaches (Section\u00a03.4.2.6), salt marshes (Section\u00a03.4.2.5) and seagrass beds (high confidence) (Section\u00a03.4.2.5; Sydeman et\u00a0al., 2015; \nBindoff et\u00a0al., 2019a; Ropert-Coudert et\u00a0al., 2019; Von Holle et\u00a0al., 2019; Albouy et\u00a0al., 2020; Amano et\u00a0al., 2020; Bestley et\u00a0al., 2020; Grose \net\u00a0al., 2020). With warming, shorebird population abundances decline in the tropics, likely due to heat stress and habitat loss, and increase \nat higher latitudes (Amano et\u00a0al., 2020). Marine mammals dependent on sea ice habitat are particularly vulnerable to warming (medium \nconfidence) (Albouy et\u00a0al., 2020; Bestley et\u00a0al., 2020; Lefort et\u00a0al., 2020), yet vulnerability can differ between populations. Ongoing sea ice\n\npage_label: 445\nfile_name: IPCC_AR6_WGII_Chapter03.pdf\n\n3\n445Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Services  Chapter 3\nIncreased emergence of infectious disease in mammals and birds is expected with ocean warming, due to new transmission pathways \nfrom changing species distributions, higher species densities caused by habitat loss and increased vulnerability due to environmental \nstress on individuals (limited evidence) (Sydeman et\u00a0al., 2015; VanWormer et\u00a0al., 2019; Sanderson and Alexander, 2020).Marine birds and \nmammals are likely to suffer from increased mortalities due to increasing frequencies of HABs, and of extreme weather, at sea, on sea ice, \nand in terrestrial breeding habitats (Broadwater et\u00a0al., 2018; Gibble and Hoover, 2018; Ropert-Coudert et\u00a0al., 2019; Grose et\u00a0al., 2020).Also, \nclimate-change driven distributional shifts have strengthened interactions with other anthropogenic impacts, through, for example, \nincreasing risks of ship strikes and bycatch (medium confidence) (e.g., Hauser et\u00a0al., 2018; Kr\u00fcger et\u00a0al., 2018; Record et\u00a0al., 2019; Santora \net\u00a0al., 2020).Box 3.2 (continued)\nthe risk of abrupt ecosystem shifts (high confidence) (Figure\u00a0 3.19a; \nCross-Chapter\u00a0Box\u00a0EXTREMES in Chapter\u00a02; van der Bolt et\u00a0al., 2018; \nGarrabou et\u00a0al., 2021; Wernberg, 2021).Ecosystems can recover from abrupt shifts (e.g., Babcock et\u00a0al., 2019; \nChristie et\u00a0al., 2019; Medrano et\u00a0al., 2020).However, where climate \nchange is a dominant driver, ecosystem collapses increasingly cause \npermanent transitions (high confidence), although the extents of \nsuch transitions depend on the emission scenario (Trisos et\u00a0al., 2020; \nGarrabou et\u00a0al., 2021; Klein et\u00a0al., 2021; Pratchett et\u00a0al., 2021; Wernberg, \n2021).Over the coming decades, MHWs are projected to very likely \nbecome more frequent under all emission scenarios (Section\u00a03.2; WGI \nAR6 Chapter\u00a0 9; Fox-Kemper et\u00a0 al., 2021), with intensities and rates \ntoo high for recovery of degraded foundational species, habitats or \nbiodiversity (medium confidence) (Babcock et\u00a0 al., 2019; Garrabou \net\u00a0al., 2021; Klein et\u00a0al., 2021; Serrano et\u00a0al., 2021; Wernberg, 2021).Emission pathways that result in temperature overshoot above 1.5oC \nwill increase the risks of abrupt and irreversible shifts in coral reefs and \nother vulnerable ecosystems (Section\u00a03.4.4).3.4.3.3.4 Time of emergence: species exposure to altered \nenvironments\nSince SROCC, more studies have assessed the time of emergence for \nclimate-induced drivers (Section\u00a0 3.2.3) and the ecosystem attributes \nthrough which the impacts manifest.However, as in\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: What are the greatest current hazards to marine birds and mammals according to the Red List Species Assessments of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN, 2020)?\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The greatest current hazards to marine birds and mammals, according to the Red List Species Assessments of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN, 2020), include human use of biological resources and areas, invasive species, and pollution.

Gait\u00e1n-Espitia et\u00a0al., 2017b; Li et\u00a0al., \n2018a).Other mechanisms acting within and across generations can influence \nselection and inter-population tolerances to environmental and \nclimate-induced drivers.For instance, transgenerational effects and/or \ndevelopmental acclimation, both \u2018carry-over effects\u2019 (where the early-\nlife environment affects the expression of traits in later life stages or \ngenerations), can influence within- and cross-generational changes \nin the tolerances of marine organisms (medium confidence) to ocean \nwarming (Balogh and Byrne, 2020) and acidification (Parker et\u00a0al., 2012).Over longer time scales, increasing tolerance to these drivers may be \nmediated by mechanisms such as transgenerational plasticity (Murray \net\u00a0al., 2014), leading to locally adapted genotypes as seen in bivalves \n(Thomsen et\u00a0al., 2017), annelids (Rodr\u00edguez-Romero et\u00a0al., 2016; Thibault \net\u00a0al., 2020), corals (Putnam et\u00a0al., 2020) and coralline algae (Cornwall \net\u00a0 al., 2020).However, transgenerational plasticity is species specific \n(Byrne et\u00a0al., 2020; Thibault et\u00a0al., 2020) and, depending on the rate and \nmagnitude of environmental change, it may either be insufficient for \nevolutionary rescue (Morgan et\u00a0al., 2020) or could induce maladaptive \nresponses (i.e., reduced fitness) in marine organisms exposed to multiple \ndrivers (medium confidence, low evidence) (Figure\u00a0 3.11; Griffith and \nGobler, 2017; Parker et\u00a0al., 2017; Byrne et\u00a0al., 2020).Acclimation to environmental pressures and climate change via \nphenotypic plasticity (Section\u00a0 3.3.3; Collins et\u00a0 al., 2020) enables \nspecies to undergo niche shifts such that their present-day climatic \nniche is altered to incorporate new or shifted conditions (Fox et\u00a0al., \n2019).Although plasticity provides an adaptive mechanism, it is \nunlikely to provide a long-term solution for species undergoing \nsustained directional environmental change (e.g., global warming) \n(medium confidence) (Fox et\u00a0 al., 2019; Gait\u00e1n-Espitia and Hobday, \n2021).Beyond the limits for plastic responses (Figure\u00a0 3.9; DeWitt \net\u00a0al., 1998; Valladares et\u00a0al., 2007), genetic adjustments are required \nto persist in a changing world (Figure\u00a0 3.11; Fox et\u00a0 al., 2019).The \nability of species and populations to undergo these adjustments (i.e., \nadaptive evolution) depends on extrinsic factors including the rate \nand magnitude of environmental change (important determinants \nof the strength and form of selection;

\nNagelkerken et\u00a0 al., 2020; Henson et\u00a0 al., 2021), altering both the \nfunctioning and structure of marine ecosystems and thus affecting \nservice provisioning (medium confidence) (Section\u00a03.5; Ibarbalz et\u00a0al., \n2019; Righetti et\u00a0al., 2019).However, biodiversity observations remain sparse, and statistical and \nmodelling tools can provide conflicting diversity information (e.g., \nRighetti et\u00a0 al., 2019; Dutkiewicz et\u00a0 al., 2020) because correlative \napproaches assume that the modern-day relationship between \nmarine species distribution and environmental conditions remains \nthe same into the future, whereas mechanistic models permit \nmarine species to respond dynamically to changing environmental \nforcing.Moreover, existing global projections of future biodiversity \ndisproportionately focus on the effects sea surface temperature \n(Thomas et\u00a0 al., 2012), typically overlooking other factors such \nas ocean acidification, deoxygenation and nutrient availability \n(Section\u00a03.2.3), and often failing to account for natural adaptation \n(e.g., Section\u00a03.3.4;

The abruptness, intensity, duration, magnitude, and reoccurrence of extreme events may alter or prevent evolutionary responses such as adaptation and acclimation to extreme conditions. Some marine organisms have shown higher phenotypic plasticity and tolerance to ocean warming and acidification, especially those living in coastal zones with strong temporal fluctuations in environmental conditions. However, this plasticity may not provide a long-term solution for species undergoing sustained directional environmental change, such as global warming. Beyond the limits for plastic responses, genetic adjustments are required for species to persist in a changing world. The ability of species and populations to undergo these adjustments, or adaptive evolution, depends on extrinsic factors including the rate and magnitude of environmental change. \n\nFurthermore, climate change can lead to species redistributions, including extirpations and range contractions in the tropics, and range expansions at higher latitudes. This can result in decreased biodiversity in tropical regions and increased diversity and homogenisation of marine communities at higher latitudes. The projected loss of biodiversity may ultimately threaten marine ecosystem stability, altering both the functioning and structure of marine ecosystems and thus affecting service provisioning.

Nevertheless, even under an intermediate \nemission scenario RCP4.5, increasing ice-free periods will likely reduce both recruitment and adult survival across most polar bear \npopulations over the next four decades, threatening their existence (medium confidence) (see Figure\u00a0Box\u00a03.2.2; Moln\u00e1r et\u00a0al., 2020).\nClimate change is affecting marine food-web dynamics (high confidence) (Sections\u00a03.4.2, 3.4.3), and the vulnerability and adaptive \ncapacity of marine birds and mammals to such changes is linked to the species\u2019 breeding and feeding ecology. Higher-vulnerability \nspecies include central-place foragers (confined to, for example, breeding colonies fixed in space), diet and habitat specialists, and species \nwith restricted distributions such as marine mammal populations in SES (medium confidence) (McMahon et\u00a0al., 2019; Ropert-Coudert \net\u00a0al., 2019; Albouy et\u00a0al., 2020; Grose et\u00a0al., 2020; Sydeman et\u00a0al., 2021). Surface-feeding and piscivorous marine birds appear to be more \nvulnerable to food-web changes than diving seabirds and planktivorous seabirds (medium confidence) (Sydeman et\u00a0al., 2021). During \nthe 2014\u20132015 Pacific heatwave, around 1\u00a0million piscivorous common murres died along a 1500 km coastal stretch in the Pacific USA \ndue to reduced prey availability (Jones et\u00a0al., 2018b; Piatt et\u00a0al., 2020).
