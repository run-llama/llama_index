Ride-hailing: This is the core service where users can request rides from point A to B. There are different categories in this, like UberX, UberXL, Uber Black, and Uber Pool, each offering different levels of service and price points.\n\n2. Uber Eats: This is a food delivery service where users can order food from local restaurants and have it delivered to their location.\n\n3. Uber Freight: This service connects shippers with truckers, much like the ride-hailing service does with drivers and riders.\n\n4. Advanced Technologies Group: This division of Uber is working on self-driving technology.\n\n5. Uber Health: This service provides patient transportation for healthcare providers.\n\n6.

In the first quarter, the pandemic's impact on global financial markets and economies led to uncertainties and volatility that affected these estimates.
