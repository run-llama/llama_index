    "In this notebook, we demonstrate how to utilize the `AnswerRelevancyEvaluator` and `ContextRelevancyEvaluator` classes to get a measure on the relevancy of a generated answer and retrieved contexts, respectively, to a given user query. Both of these evaluators return a `score` that is between 0 and 1 as well as a generated `feedback` explaining the score. Note that, higher score means higher relevancy. In particular, we prompt the judge LLM to take a step-by-step approach in providing a relevancy score, asking it to answer the following two questions of a generated answer to a query for answer relevancy (for context relevancy these are slightly adjusted):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Does the provided response match the subject matter of the user's query?\n",
    "2. Does the provided response attempt to address the focus or perspective on the subject matter taken on by the user's query?\n",
    "\n",
    "Each question is worth 1 point and so a perfect evaluation would yield a score of 2/2."

They have attracted significant attention\\nand been deployed in numerous downstream applications. Nevertheless, akin\\nto a double-edged sword, LLMs also present potential risks. They could\\nsuffer from private data leaks or yield inappropriate, harmful, or misleading\\ncontent. Additionally, the rapid progress of LLMs raises concerns about the\\npotential emergence of superintelligent systems without adequate safeguards.\\nTo effectively capitalize on LLM capacities as well as ensure their safe and\\nbeneficial development, it is critical to conduct a rigorous and comprehensive\\nevaluation of LLMs.\\nThis survey endeavors to offer a panoramic perspective on the evaluation\\nof LLMs. We categorize the evaluation of LLMs into three major groups:\\nknowledgeandcapabilityevaluation, alignmentevaluationandsafetyevaluation.\\nIn addition to the comprehensive review on the evaluation methodologies and\\nbenchmarks on these three aspects, we collate a compendium of evaluations\\npertaining to LLMs’ performance in specialized domains, and discuss the\\nconstruction of comprehensive evaluation platforms that cover LLM evaluations\\non capabilities, alignment, safety, and applicability.\\nWe hope that this comprehensive overview will stimulate further research\\ninterests in the evaluation of LLMs, with the ultimate goal of making evaluation\\nserve as a cornerstone in guiding the responsible development of LLMs. We\\nenvision that this will channel their evolution into a direction that maximizes\\nsocietal benefit while minimizing potential risks.

Multilingual Holistic Bias (Costa-jussà et al., 2023) extends the HolisticBias dataset\\nto 50 languages, achieving the largest scale of English template-based text expansion.\\nWhether using automatic or manual evaluations, both approaches inevitably carry human\\nsubjectivity and cannot establish a comprehensive and fair evaluation standard. Unqover\\n(Li et al., 2020) is the first to transform the task of evaluating biases generated by models\\ninto a multiple-choice question, covering gender, nationality, race, and religion categories.\\nThey provide models with ambiguous and disambiguous contexts and ask them to choose\\nbetween options with and without stereotypes, evaluating both PLMs and models fine-tuned\\non multiple-choice question answering datasets. BBQ (Parrish et al., 2022) adopts this\\napproach but extends the types of biases to nine categories. All sentence templates are\\nmanually created, and in addition to the two contrasting group answers, the model is also\\nprovided with correct answers like “I don’t know” and “I’m not sure”, and a statistical bias\\nscore metric is proposed to evaluate multiple question answering models. CBBQ (Huang\\n& Xiong, 2023) extends BBQ to Chinese. Based on Chinese socio-cultural factors, CBBQ\\nadds four categories: disease, educational qualification, household registration, and region.\\nThey manually rewrite ambiguous text templates and use GPT-4 to generate disambiguous\\ntemplates, greatly increasing the dataset’s diversity and extensibility. Additionally, they\\nimprove the experimental setup for LLMs and evaluate existing Chinese open-source LLMs,\\nfinding that current Chinese LLMs not only have higher bias scores but also exhibit behavioral\\ninconsistencies, revealing a significant gap compared to GPT-3.5-Turbo.\\nIn addition to these aforementioned evaluation methods, we could also use advanced LLMs for\\nscoring bias, such as GPT-4, or employ models that perform best in training bias detection\\ntasks to detect the level of bias in answers. Such models can be used not only in the evaluation\\nphase but also for identifying biases in data for pre-training LLMs, facilitating debiasing in\\ntraining data.\\nAs the development of multilingual LLMs and domain-specific LLMs progresses, studies on\\nthe fairness of these models become increasingly important. Zhao et al. (2020) create datasets\\nto study gender bias in multilingual embeddings and cross-lingual tasks, revealing gender\\nbias from both internal and external perspectives. Moreover, FairLex (Chalkidis et al., 2022)\\nproposes a multilingual legal dataset as fairness benchmark, covering four judicial jurisdictions\\n(European Commission, United States, Swiss Federation, and People’s Republic of China), five\\nlanguages (English, German, French, Italian, and Chinese), and various sensitive attributes\\n(gender, age, region, etc.). As LLMs have been applied and deployed in the finance and legal\\nsectors, these studies deserve high attention.\\n4.3 Toxicity\\nLLMs are usually trained on a huge amount of online data which may contain toxic behavior\\nand unsafe content. These include hate speech, offensive/abusive language, pornographic\\ncontent, etc. It is hence very desirable to evaluate how well trained LLMs deal with toxicity.\\nConsidering the proficiency of LLMs in understanding and generating sentences, we categorize\\nthe evaluation of toxicity into two tasks: toxicity identification and classification evaluation,\\nand the evaluation of toxicity in generated sentences.\\n29']</td>\n",
