In addition, Drivers\\nmay be subject to climate-related policies that indirectly impact our business, such as the Congestion Charge Zone and Ultra Low Emission Zone schemes adopted\\nin London that impose fees on drivers in fossil-fueled vehicles, which may impact our ability to attract and maintain Drivers on our platform, and to the extent we\\nexperience Driver supply constraints in a given market, we may need to increase Driver incentives.\\nWe have made climate related commitments that require us to invest significant effort, resources, and management time and circumstances may arise,\\nincluding those beyond our control, that may require us to revise the contemplated timeframes for implementing these commitments.\\nWe have made climate related commitments, including our commitment to 100% renewable electricity for our U.S. offices by 2025, our commitment to net\\nzero climate emissions from corporate operations by 2030, and our commitment to be a net zero company by 2040. In addition, our Supplier Code of Conduct sets\\nenvironmental standards for our supply chain, and we recognize that there are inherent climate-related risks wherever business is conducted. Progressing towards\\nour climate commitments requires us to invest significant effort, resources, and management time, and circumstances may arise, including those beyond our\\ncontrol, that may require us to revise our timelines and/or climate commitments. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted our ability to\\ndedicate resources to make the progress on our climate commitments that we initially anticipated. In addition, our ability to meet our climate commitments is\\ndependent on external factors such as rapidly changing regulations, policies and related interpretation, advances in technology such as battery storage, as well the\\navailability, cost and accessibility of EVs to Drivers, and the availability of EV charging infrastructure that can be efficiently accessed by Drivers.
