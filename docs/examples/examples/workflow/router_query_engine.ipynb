Initially drawn to philosophy in college, he found it unfulfilling and shifted his focus to AI, inspired by literature and documentaries. His academic pursuits led him to reverse-engineer a natural language program, but he soon realized the limitations of AI at the time.\n",

       "After completing his PhD, he ventured into the art world, taking classes and painting, while also working on a book about Lisp programming. His experiences in the tech industry, particularly at a software company, shaped his understanding of business dynamics and the importance of being an entry-level option in the market.\n",
       "\n",
       "In the mid-1990s, he co-founded Viaweb, an early web application for building online stores, which was later acquired by Yahoo. Following this, he became involved in angel investing and co-founded Y Combinator, a startup accelerator that revolutionized seed funding by supporting multiple startups simultaneously.\n",

       "Answer: Growing up, the author focused on writing and programming outside of school. Initially, he wrote short stories, which he later described as lacking in plot but rich in character emotions. He began programming at a young age on an IBM 1401, where he experimented with early Fortran and punch cards. Eventually, he convinced his father to buy a TRS-80 microcomputer, which allowed him to write simple games and a word processor. Despite enjoying programming, he initially planned to study philosophy in college, believing it to be a pursuit of ultimate truths. However, he later switched his focus to artificial intelligence after finding philosophy courses unengaging."

The program fostered a supportive community among founders and marked a transition for YC from a small initiative to a larger organization. Significant individuals during this time included Jessica Livingston, with whom the author had a close professional and personal relationship, as well as Robert Morris and Trevor Blackwell, who contributed to the development of shopping cart software and were recognized for their programming skills, respectively.
