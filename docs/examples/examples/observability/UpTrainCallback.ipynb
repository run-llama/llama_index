    "# UpTrain Callback Handler\n",
    "\n",
    "UpTrain ([github](https://github.com/uptrain-ai/uptrain) || [website](https://github.com/uptrain-ai/uptrain/) || [docs](https://docs.uptrain.ai/)) is an open-source platform to evaluate and improve GenAI applications. It provides grades for 20+ preconfigured checks (covering language, code, embedding use cases), performs root cause analysis on failure cases and gives insights on how to resolve them. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook showcases how to use UpTrain Callback Handler to evaluate different components of your RAG pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. **RAG Query Engine Evaluations**:\n",
    "The RAG query engine plays a crucial role in retrieving context and generating responses. To ensure its performance and response quality, we conduct the following evaluations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[Context Relevance](https://docs.uptrain.ai/predefined-evaluations/context-awareness/context-relevance)**: Determines if the retrieved context has sufficient information to answer the user query or not.\n",
    "- **[Factual Accuracy](https://docs.uptrain.ai/predefined-evaluations/context-awareness/factual-accuracy)**: Assesses if the LLM's response can be verified via the retrieved context.\n",
    "- **[Response Completeness](https://docs.uptrain.ai/predefined-evaluations/response-quality/response-completeness)**: Checks if the response contains all the information required to answer the user query comprehensively.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. **Sub-Question Query Generation Evaluation**:\n",
    "The SubQuestionQueryGeneration operator decomposes a question into sub-questions, generating responses for each using an RAG query engine. To measure it's accuracy, we use:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[Sub Query Completeness](https://docs.uptrain.ai/predefined-evaluations/query-quality/sub-query-completeness)**: Assures that the sub-questions accurately and comprehensively cover the original query.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. **Re-Ranking Evaluations**:\n",
    "Re-ranking involves reordering nodes based on relevance to the query and choosing the top nodes. Different evaluations are performed based on the number of nodes returned after re-ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Same Number of Nodes\n",
    "- **[Context Reranking](https://docs.uptrain.ai/predefined-evaluations/context-awareness/context-reranking)**: Checks if the order of re-ranked nodes is more relevant to the query than the original order.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Different Number of Nodes:\n",
    "- **[Context Conciseness](https://docs.uptrain.ai/predefined-evaluations/context-awareness/context-conciseness)**: Examines whether the reduced number of nodes still provides all the required information.\n",
    "\n",
    "These evaluations collectively ensure the robustness and effectiveness of the RAG query engine, SubQuestionQueryGeneration operator, and the re-ranking process in the LlamaIndex pipeline."

    "\n",
    "UpTrain provides you with:\n",
    "1. Dashboards with advanced drill-down and filtering options\n",
    "1. Insights and common topics among failing cases\n",
    "1. Observability and real-time monitoring of production data\n",
    "1. Regression testing via seamless integration with your CI/CD pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "You can choose between the following options for evaluating using UpTrain:\n",
    "### 1. **UpTrain's Open-Source Software (OSS)**: \n",
    "You can use the open-source evaluation service to evaluate your model. In this case, you will need to provide an OpenAI API key. You can get yours [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to view your evaluations in the UpTrain dashboard, you will need to set it up by running the following commands in your terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/uptrain-ai/uptrain\n",
    "cd uptrain\n",
    "bash run_uptrain.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will start the UpTrain dashboard on your local machine. You can access it at `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters:\n",
    "- key_type=\"openai\"\n",
    "- api_key=\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"\n",
    "- project_name=\"PROJECT_NAME\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **UpTrain Managed Service and Dashboards**:\n",
    "Alternatively, you can use UpTrain's managed service to evaluate your model. You can create a free UpTrain account [here](https://uptrain.ai/) and get free trial credits. If you want more trial credits, [book a call with the maintainers of UpTrain here](https://calendly.com/uptrain-sourabh/30min).\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefits of using the managed service are:\n",
    "1. No need to set up the UpTrain dashboard on your local machine.\n",
    "1. Access to many LLMs without needing their API keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you perform the evaluations, you can view them in the UpTrain dashboard at `https://dashboard.uptrain.ai/dashboard`\n",

    "- api_key=\"UPTRAIN_API_KEY\"\n",
    "- project_name=\"PROJECT_NAME\"\n",
