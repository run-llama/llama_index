    "> After going to RISD, Paul Graham continued to pursue his passion for painting and art. He took classes in the painting department at the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence, and he also took the entrance exam for the school. He also continued to work on his book On Lisp, and he took on consulting work to make money. At the school, Paul Graham and the other students had an arrangement where the faculty wouldn't require the students to learn anything, and in return the students wouldn't require the faculty to teach anything. Paul Graham was one of the few students who actually painted the nude model that was provided, while the rest of the students spent their time chatting or occasionally trying to imitate things they'd seen in American art magazines. The model turned out to live just down the street from Paul Graham, and she made a living from a combination of modelling and making fakes for a local antique dealer."

He recruited Dan Giffin and two undergrads to help him, but he eventually realized he didn't want to run a company and decided to build a subset of the project as an open source project.
