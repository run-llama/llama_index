Politics is all about dividing people into groups and creating artificial boundaries between them, whereas technology is all about connecting people and breaking down those boundaries. This is why, in my opinion, the most innovative and successful companies are often those that are most apolitical. They're not trying to create a particular ideology or agenda, they're just trying to solve real problems and make people's lives better. And that's why, in the end, technology will always win out over politics. It's just more effective.\"assistant|>\n",

It's also true that some of the most successful companies are those that are able to stay focused on their goals and avoid getting caught up in political ideology.assistant|>\n",
