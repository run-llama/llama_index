This ensures that variables are always used in a type-safe manner, preventing many types of errors from occurring at runtime. Examples of statically typed languages include Java, C, C++, and C#.\n",
      "\n",
      "In dynamically typed languages, the type of a variable is determined at runtime, which means that the type is checked as the program is running. This provides more flexibility, as variables can be assigned values of different types at different times, but it also means that type errors may not be caught until the program is running, which can make debugging more difficult. Examples of dynamically typed languages include Python, Ruby, JavaScript, and PHP.\n",
      "\n",
      "One key difference between statically typed and dynamically typed languages is that statically typed languages tend to be more verbose, requiring explicit type declarations for variables, while dynamically typed languages are more concise and allow for implicit type declarations.
