      "**Ingredients:**\n",
      "- 2 cups (240g) all-purpose flour\n",
      "- 1 Â¾ cups (350g) granulated sugar\n",
      "- 3 teaspoons baking powder\n",
      "- Â½ teaspoon salt\n",
      "- â…“ cup (80g) unsalted butter, softened\n",
      "- 1 cup (240ml) whole milk, at room temperature\n",
      "- 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract\n",
      "- 3 large eggs, at room temperature\n",
      "\n",
      "**Instructions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Preheat the Oven**: Preheat your oven to 350Â°F (175Â°C). Grease two 9-inch round cake pans with butter or cooking spray, then line the bottoms with parchment paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Dry Ingredients**: In a large mixing bowl, sift together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Make sure everything is well combined.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cream the Butter and Sugar**: In another large bowl, beat the softened butter until creamy. Gradually add the sugar and continue beating until light and fluffy, about 3-4 minutes.\n",

      "4. **Add Eggs and Vanilla**: Beat in the eggs one at a time, making sure each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next. Mix in the vanilla extract.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Combine Wet and Dry**: With the mixer on low speed, alternately add the dry ingredients mixture and milk into the wet mixture in three parts, starting and ending with the flour mixture. Be careful not to overmix; stop as soon as the ingredients are just combined.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Pour and Bake**: Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans. Smooth the tops with a spatula. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of each cake comes out clean.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Cool the Cake**: Remove cakes from the oven and let them cool in their pans for about 10 minutes. Then, remove from the pans and transfer onto wire racks to cool completely.\n",

      "8. **Frosting and Assembly**: Once cooled, you can frost and assemble the cake with your favorite frosting, such as buttercream. Place one cake layer on a plate or cake stand, spread frosting over the top, then place the second cake layer on top. Frost the top and sides of the cake as desired.\n",
      "\n",
