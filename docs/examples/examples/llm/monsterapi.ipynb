In contrast, generation involves creating new content based on a given prompt or input. By combining these two tasks, RAG enables models to generate novel content while also drawing upon previously learned knowledge.\n",

This can help the generator produce more coherent and informative responses by leveraging the contextual relationships between the generated text and the retrieved sentences.\n",

The goal of RAG is to leverage the ability of pre-trained language models to generate coherent and contextually relevant text while also providing more precise control over the retrieved information through the use of explicit non-parametric memory retrieval.\n",

With the help of these technologies, a car is able to navigate itself through a landscape independently, without any human intervention.\\n\\nTo do this, the car uses a large number of sensors to gather real-time data from its surroundings. This data is then fed into a high-performance computer that can analyze it in real-time, enabling the car to make informed decisions on how to proceed.\\n\\nAI and ML are also used to improve the performance and efficiency of cars, helping to optimize factors such as fuel consumption, emissions, and driving experience.\\n\\nAs these technologies continue to advance, we can expect to see a significant increase in the number of autonomous vehicles on our roads in the coming years. This will require a significant investment in infrastructure, such as more advanced sensors, improved connectivity, and smarter traffic management systems.\\n\\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation is a subfield of Natural Language Generation (NLG). It combines the power of NLG with that of Retrieval-based Methods to generate more accurate and relevant content.\\n\\nRetrieval-based Methods are techniques used in Information Retrieval (IR) to efficiently search for and retrieve relevant information from large collections of text. They typically involve indexing the text to make it searchable, and then using sophisticated algorithms to rank the results based on relevance.\\n\\nIn Retrieval-Augmented Generation, the NLG system first searches for relevant information using Retrieval-based Methods, and then uses this information to generate new content. This approach allows the system to incorporate a wider range of information and perspectives into its output, making it more accurate, relevant, and diverse.\\n\\nSome examples of how Retrieval-Augmented Generation is being used in industry include:\\n\\n1. E-commerce: Retrieval-Augmented Generation can be used to generate product descriptions and recommendations, incorporating information from a wide range of sources to provide customers with more comprehensive and accurate information.\\n\\n2.
