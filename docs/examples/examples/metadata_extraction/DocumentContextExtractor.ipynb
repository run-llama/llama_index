    "# Contextual Retrieval With Llama Index\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook covers contextual retrieval with llama_index DocumentContextExtractor\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on an Anthropic [blost post](https://www.anthropic.com/news/contextual-retrieval), the concept is to:\n",
    "1. Use an LLM to generate a 'context' for each chunk based on the entire document\n",
    "2. embed the chunk + context together\n",
    "3. reap the benefits of higher RAG accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "While you can also do this manually, the DocumentContextExtractor offers a lot of convenience and error handling, plus you can integrate it into your llama_index pipelines! Let's get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: This notebook costs about $0.02 everytime you run it."

I wrote what beginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still are: short stories. They were awful. They had hardly any plot, just characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them deep. The first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our school district used for what was then called \"data processing.\" This was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The district's machine happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and my friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. The space was like a mini Bond villain's lair down there, with all these alien-looking machines — CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader — sitting up on a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights. The language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to type programs on punch cards, then stack them in the reader and press a button to load the code into memory and run it. The result would ordinarily be to print something\n"
