    "In this section we stress-test long context recall capabilities of GPT-4 and Claude v2. This is inspired by [Greg Kamradt's tweet](https://x.com/GregKamradt/status/1722386725635580292?s=20). \n",

    "Similarly, we analyze the \"needle in a haystack\" recall capabilities of long-context LLms. We show an incremental extension by 1) adding Claude, and 2) testing recall where context **exceeds** context window, triggering response synthesis strategies.\n",
