    "# IPEX-LLM on Intel GPU\n",
    "> [IPEX-LLM](https://github.com/intel-analytics/ipex-llm/) is a PyTorch library for running LLM on Intel CPU and GPU (e.g., local PC with iGPU, discrete GPU such as Arc, Flex and Max) with very low latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example goes over how to use LlamaIndex to interact with [`ipex-llm`](https://github.com/intel-analytics/ipex-llm/) for text generation and chat on Intel GPU. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> You could refer to [here](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/tree/main/llama-index-integrations/llms/llama-index-llms-ipex-llm/examples) for full examples of `IpexLLM`. Please note that for running on Intel GPU, please specify `-d 'xpu'` or `-d 'xpu:<device_id>'` in command argument when running the examples.\n",

    "## Install Prerequisites\n",
    "To benefit from IPEX-LLM on Intel GPUs, there are several prerequisite steps for tools installation and environment preparation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are a Windows user, visit the [Install IPEX-LLM on Windows with Intel GPU Guide](https://ipex-llm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doc/LLM/Quickstart/install_windows_gpu.html), and follow [**Install Prerequisites**](https://ipex-llm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doc/LLM/Quickstart/install_windows_gpu.html#install-prerequisites) to update GPU driver (optional) and install Conda.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are a Linux user, visit the [Install IPEX-LLM on Linux with Intel GPU](https://ipex-llm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doc/LLM/Quickstart/install_linux_gpu.html), and follow [**Install Prerequisites**](https://ipex-llm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doc/LLM/Quickstart/install_linux_gpu.html#install-prerequisites) to install GPU driver, IntelÂ® oneAPI Base Toolkit 2024.0, and Conda.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install `llama-index-llms-ipex-llm`\n",
    "\n",
    "After the prerequisites installation, you should have created a conda environment with all prerequisites installed, activate your conda environment and install `llama-index-llms-ipex-llm` as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda activate <your-conda-env-name>\n",
    "\n",
    "pip install llama-index-llms-ipex-llm[xpu] --extra-index-url https://pytorch-extension.intel.com/release-whl/stable/xpu/us/\n",
    "```\n",
    "This step will also install `ipex-llm` and its dependencies.\n",

    "\n",
    "Before loading the Zephyr model, you'll need to define `completion_to_prompt` and `messages_to_prompt` for formatting prompts. Follow proper prompt format for zephyr-7b-alpha following the [model card](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-alpha). This is essential for preparing inputs that the model can interpret accurately. Load the Zephyr model locally using IpexLLM using `IpexLLM.from_model_id`. It will load the model directly in its Huggingface format and convert it automatically to low-bit format for inference.\n",

    "Alternatively, you might save the low-bit model to disk once and use `from_model_id_low_bit` instead of `from_model_id` to reload it for later use - even across different machines. It is space-efficient, as the low-bit model demands significantly less disk space than the original model.
