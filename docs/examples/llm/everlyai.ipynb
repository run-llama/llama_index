Lily closed her eyes and let the sound of the waves wash over her, feeling the stress of her daily life melt away.\n",

Curious, she leaned forward and saw that the bird was carrying a small, shimmering shell. The bird dropped the shell at Lily's feet, and she picked it up, feeling its smooth surface and admiring its beauty.\n",
