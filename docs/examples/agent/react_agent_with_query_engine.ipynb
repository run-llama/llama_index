These risk factors include general economic factors such as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, natural disasters, economic downturns, and political crises. Operational factors such as limited operating history, financial performance, competition, unpredictability of results, uncertainty regarding market growth, ability to attract and retain drivers and riders, insurance coverage, autonomous vehicle technology, reputation and brand, illegal or improper activity on the platform, accuracy of background checks, changes to pricing practices, growth management, security and privacy breaches, reliance on third parties, and ability to operate various programs and services. Additionally, Lyft faces risks related to its evolving business, including forecasting revenue and managing expenses, complying with laws and regulations, managing assets and expenses during the COVID-19 pandemic, capital expenditures, asset development and utilization, macroeconomic changes, reputation and brand management, growth and business operations, geographic expansion, talent acquisition and retention, platform development, and real estate portfolio management. Furthermore, Lyft's financial performance in recent periods may not be indicative of future performance, and achieving or maintaining profitability in the future is not guaranteed. The Express Drive program and Lyft Rentals program also expose Lyft to risks related to vehicle rental partners, residual value of vehicles, and payment processing.\n",
