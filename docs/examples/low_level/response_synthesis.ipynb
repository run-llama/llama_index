      "supervised annotation, attracted by its denser signal. Meanwhile reinforcement learning, known for its insta-\n",
      "bility, seemed a somewhat shadowy field for those in the NLP research community. However, reinforcement\n",

      "that the crucial determinant of RLHF’s success lies in the synergy it fosters between humans and LLMs\n",
      "throughout the annotation process.\n",
      "Even with proficient annotators, each individual writes with significant variation. A model fine-tuned on\n",
      "SFT annotation learns this diversity, including, unfortunately, the tail-end of poorly executed annotation. Fur-\n",
      "thermore, the model’s performance is capped by the writing abilities of the most skilled annotators. Human\n",
      "annotators are arguably less subject to discrepancy when comparing two outputs’ preference annotation\n",
      "for RLHF. Consequently, the reward mechanism swiftly learns to assign low scores to undesirable tail-end\n",
      "distribution and aligns towards the human preference. This phenomena is illustrated in Figure 20, where we\n",
      "can see that the worst answers are progressively removed, shifting the distribution to the right.\n",
      "In addition, during annotation, the model has the potential to venture into writing trajectories that even the\n",
      "best annotators may not chart. Nonetheless, humans can still provide valuable feedback when comparing two\n",
      "answers, beyond their own writing competencies. Drawing a parallel, while we may not all be accomplished\n",

      "the context. As indicated in Figure 8, the temperature appears to be influenced by RLHF. Yet, intriguingly,\n",
      "our findings also revealed that the shifts are not uniformly applied across all prompts, as shown in Figure 21.\n",
      "For instance, when it comes to prompts associated with creativity, such as “Write a poem,” an increase in\n",
      "temperature continues to generate diversity across our various RLHF iterations. This can be observed in the\n",
      "Self-BLEU slope, which mirrors a pattern comparable to that of the SFT model.\n",
