    "# Ensemble Retrieval Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "Oftentimes when building a RAG applications there are many retreival parameters/strategies to decide from (from chunk size to vector vs. keyword vs. hybrid search, for instance).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thought: what if we could try a bunch of strategies at once, and have any AI/reranker/LLM prune the results?\n",
    "\n",
    "This achieves two purposes:\n",
    "- Better (albeit more costly) retrieved results by pooling results from multiple strategies, assuming the reranker is good\n",
    "- A way to benchmark different retrieval strategies against each other (w.r.t reranker)\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide showcases this over the Great Gatsby. We do ensemble retrieval over different chunk sizes and also different indices."

       "**`Final Response:`** The interactions between Gatsby and Daisy are full of tension and emotion. Daisy is drawn to Gatsby's cool demeanor and his mysterious past, and Gatsby is captivated by Daisy's beauty and her voice, which he describes as \"full of money.\" They are constantly aware of each other's presence, and when they are together, they are often lost in their own world. At one point, Daisy tells Gatsby that she loves him, and Tom Buchanan sees. Tom is astounded and looks between Gatsby and Daisy as if he has just recognized her from a long time ago. Daisy then innocently remarks that Gatsby looks like the advertisement of a man, and Tom quickly interrupts and suggests they all go to town. Daisy then begs Tom to let them have some fun, but he does not answer.\n",
       "\n",
       "When they are all ready to leave, Daisy suggests that they take something to drink, and Tom goes inside to get whisky. Gatsby then turns to Nick and says he can't say anything in Tom's house. Nick remarks that Daisy has an indiscreet voice, and Gatsby responds that it is full of money. When they arrive at the party, Gatsby takes them ceremoniously from group to group, introducing them as Mr. and Mrs. Buchanan. Tom then remarks that he doesn't know anyone there, and Gatsby suggests they look around. Daisy is captivated by a gorgeous woman, and Gatsby reveals that the man bending over her is her director.\n",
       "\n",
       "When they return to Gatsby's house, Gatsby turns on the lights and they all go into the music room. Gatsby lights Daisy's cigarette and they sit on a couch far away from the light. Klipspringer plays the piano, and Gatsby commands him to play. As Nick is about to leave, he notices that Gatsby and Daisy are lost in their own world, and Gatsby's expression of bewilderment has returned, as if he is doubting the quality of his present happiness. The tension between them is palpable, and it is clear that Gatsby is deeply in love with Daisy, while Daisy is drawn to Gatsby's mysterious past and his passionate devotion to her. They are both aware of the power of their connection, and it is clear that they are both deeply affected by it."

       "**`Final Response:`** Gatsby and Daisy have a passionate and intense relationship. They are deeply in love, and Daisy is drawn to Gatsby's mysterious and glamorous lifestyle. Gatsby is devoted to Daisy, and he is willing to do anything to make her happy. In the scene described, Daisy and Gatsby are alone in the music room, and Gatsby has lit Daisy's cigarette from a trembling match. Klipspringer is playing the piano, and Gatsby tells him to stop talking and start playing. Daisy compliments Gatsby on his coolness, and they share a moment of intense eye contact. Tom Buchanan then interrupts them, and Daisy and Gatsby are forced to part. Gatsby is left with a look of bewilderment on his face, as if he is questioning the quality of his happiness. Daisy and Gatsby then part ways, with Daisy holding out her hand to Gatsby and Gatsby not recognizing the reporter who is watching them. The reporter is left with the impression that Gatsby and Daisy are deeply in love and that their relationship is full of emotion and passion."
