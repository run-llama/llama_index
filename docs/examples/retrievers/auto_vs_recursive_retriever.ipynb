    "# Comparing Methods for Structured Retrieval (Auto-Retrieval vs. Recursive Retrieval)\n",
    "\n",
    "In a naive RAG system, the set of input documents are then chunked, embedded, and dumped to a vector database collection. Retrieval would just fetch the top-k documents by embedding similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can fail if the set of documents is large - it can be hard to disambiguate raw chunks, and you're not guaranteed to filter for the set of documents that contain relevant context.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide we explore **structured retrieval** - more advanced query algorithms that take advantage of structure within your documents for higher-precision retrieval. We compare the following two methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Metadata Filters + Auto-Retrieval**: Tag each document with the right set of metadata. During query-time, use auto-retrieval to infer metadata filters along with passing through the query string for semantic search.\n",
    "- **Store Document Hierarchies (summaries -> raw chunks) + Recursive Retrieval**: Embed document summaries and map that to the set of raw chunks for each document. During query-time, do recursive retrieval to first fetch summaries before fetching documents."

      "The Super Bowl commercial inspired the 1996 live action/animated film Space Jam, which starred Jordan and Bugs in a fictional story set during the former's first retirement from basketball.They have subsequently appeared together in several commercials for MCI.Jordan also made an appearance in the music video for Michael Jackson's \"Jam\" (1992).Since 2008, Jordan's yearly income from the endorsements is estimated to be over $40 million.In addition, when Jordan's power at the ticket gates was at its highest point, the Bulls regularly sold out both their home and road games.Due to this, Jordan set records in player salary by signing annual contracts worth in excess of US$30 million per season.An academic study found that Jordan's first NBA comeback resulted in an increase in the market capitalization of his client firms of more than $1 billion.Most of Jordan's endorsement deals, including his first deal with Nike, were engineered by his agent, David Falk.Jordan has described Falk as \"the best at what he does\" and that \"marketing-wise, he's great.He's the one who came up with the concept of 'Air Jordan'.\"\n",

      "Jordan played himself in the 1996 comedy film Space Jam.The film received mixed reviews, but it was a box office success, making $230 million worldwide, and earned more than $1 billion through merchandise sales.In 2000, Jordan was the subject of an IMAX documentary about his career with the Chicago Bulls, especially the 1998 NBA playoffs, titled Michael Jordan to the Max.Two decades later, the same period of Jordan's life was covered in much greater and more personal detail by the Emmy Award-winning The Last Dance, a 10-part TV documentary which debuted on ESPN in April and May 2020.The Last Dance relied heavily on about 500 hours of candid film of Jordan's and his teammates' off-court activities which an NBA Entertainment crew had shot over the course of the 1997–98 NBA season for use in a documentary.The project was delayed for many years because Jordan had not yet given his permission for the footage to be used.\n",
      "He was interviewed at three homes associated with the production and did not want cameras in his home or on his plane, as according to director Jason Hehir \"there are certain aspects of his life that he wants to keep private\".Jordan granted rapper Travis Scott permission to film a music video for his single \"Franchise\" at his home in Highland Park, Illinois.Jordan appeared in the 2022 miniseries The Captain, which follows the life and career of Derek Jeter.\n",

      "The New York Post revealed that Musk's ex-wife Talulah Riley had encouraged Musk to purchase Twitter, specifically citing the Bee's ban.Following the acquisition, he made reinstatement of accounts like the Bee an immediate priority.The Independent reported that Musk has \"appealed to far-right activists and influencers and unleashed a wave of hate speech and abuse aimed at LGBT+ people\" since taking control of Twitter.On December 18, Musk posted a poll to his Twitter account asking users to decide whether he should step down as the head of Twitter, with 57.5% out of the more than 17.5 million votes supporting that decision.Musk then announced that he would resign as CEO \"as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job\".On May 11, 2023, Musk announced that he would be stepping down from the CEO position and instead moving to \"exec chair & CTO, overseeing product, software & sysops\" and announced the new CEO, former NBCUniversal executive Linda Yaccarino.\n",
      "Musk has made cameos and appearances in other films such as Machete Kills (2013), Why Him?(2016), and Men in Black: International (2019).Television series in which he has appeared include The Simpsons (\"The Musk Who Fell to Earth\", 2015), The Big Bang Theory (\"The Platonic Permutation\", 2015), South Park (\"Members Only\", 2016), Young Sheldon (\"A Patch, a Modem, and a Zantac®\", 2017), Rick and Morty (\"One Crew over the Crewcoo's Morty\", 2019), and Saturday Night Live (2021).He contributed interviews to the documentaries Racing Extinction (2015) and the Werner Herzog-directed Lo and Behold (2016).Musk was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2018.In 2015, he received an honorary doctorate in engineering and technology from Yale University and IEEE Honorary Membership.\n",
      "In March 2019, Musk was later one of the 187 people who received various honors conferred by the King of Thailand for involvement in the rescue effort.Soon after the rescue, Vernon Unsworth, a British recreational caver who had been exploring the cave for the previous six years and played a key advisory role in the operation, criticized the submarine on CNN as amounting to nothing more than a public relations effort with no chance of success, maintaining that Musk \"had no conception of what the cave passage was like\" and \"can stick his submarine where it hurts\".Musk asserted on Twitter that the device would have worked and referred to Unsworth as a \"pedo guy\".He deleted the tweets, and apologized, and he deleted his responses to critical tweets from Cher Scarlett, a software engineer, which had caused his followers to harass her.In an email to BuzzFeed News, Musk later called Unsworth a \"child rapist\" and said that he had married a child.In September, Unsworth filed a defamation suit in the District Court for the Central District of California.\n",

      "In the September 1996 issue of Sport, which was the publication's 50th-anniversary issue, Jordan was named the greatest athlete of the past 50 years.Jordan's athletic leaping ability, highlighted in his back-to-back Slam Dunk Contest championships in 1987 and 1988, is credited by many people with having influenced a generation of young players.Several NBA players, including James and Dwyane Wade, have stated that they considered Jordan their role model while they were growing up.In addition, commentators have dubbed a number of next-generation players \"the next Michael Jordan\" upon their entry to the NBA, including Penny Hardaway, Grant Hill, Allen Iverson, Bryant, Vince Carter, James, and Wade.Some analysts, such as The Ringer's Dan Devine, drew parallels between Jordan's experiment at point guard in the 1988–89 season and the modern NBA; for Devine, it \"inadvertently foreshadowed the modern game's stylistic shift toward monster-usage primary playmakers\", such as Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Luka Dončić, and James.Don Nelson stated: \"I would've been playing him at point guard the day he showed up as a rookie.\n",
      "In his defense, Musk argued that \"'pedo guy' was a common insult used in South Africa when I was growing up ... synonymous with 'creepy old man' and is used to insult a person's appearance and demeanor\".The defamation case began in December 2019, with Unsworth seeking $190 million in damages.During the trial Musk apologized to Unsworth again for the tweet.On December 6, the jury found in favor of Musk and ruled he was not liable.\n",
      "Elon Reeve Musk ( EE-lon; born June 28, 1971) is a business magnate and investor.Musk is the founder, chairman, CEO and chief technology officer of SpaceX;  angel investor, CEO, product architect and former chairman of Tesla, Inc.; owner, chairman and CTO of X Corp.; founder of the Boring Company; co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI; and president of the Musk Foundation.He is the wealthiest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of US$217 billion as of August 2023, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, and $219 billion according to Forbes, primarily from his ownership stakes in both Tesla and SpaceX.Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa, and briefly attended the University of Pretoria before immigrating to Canada at age 18, acquiring citizenship through his Canadian-born mother.Two years later, he matriculated at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario.Musk later transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, and received bachelor's degrees in economics and physics there.He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University.\n",
      "He also endorsed Kanye West's 2020 presidential campaign.He said he voted for Joe Biden in the 2020 U.S. presidential election.In 2022, Musk said that he could \"no longer support\" the Democrats because they are the \"party of division & hate\", and wrote a tweet encouraging \"independent-minded voters\" to vote Republican in the 2022 U.S. elections, which was an outlier among social media executives who typically avoid partisan political advocacy.He has supported Republican Ron DeSantis for the 2024 U.S. presidential election, and Twitter hosted DeSantis's campaign announcement on a Twitter Spaces event As of May 2023, Musk was declining to endorse any specific candidate.Musk opposes a \"billionaire's tax\", and has argued on Twitter with more left-leaning Democratic politicians such as Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Elizabeth Warren.He has raised questions about the Black Lives Matter protests, partially based on the fact that the phrase \"Hands up, don't shoot\" was made up.\n",
      "Two months later, Musk contracted COVID-19 and suggested his COVID-19 rapid antigen test results were dubious, after which the phrase \"Space Karen\" trended on Twitter, in reference to Musk.However, in December 2021, Musk revealed that he and his eligible children had received the vaccine.\n",

      "Musk said that the U.S. government should not provide subsidies to companies, but impose a carbon tax to discourage poor behavior.The free market, in his view, would achieve the best solution, and producing environmentally unfriendly vehicles should have consequences.Tesla has received billions of dollars in subsidies.In addition, Tesla made large sums from government-initiated systems of zero-emissions credits offered in California and at the United States federal level, which facilitated initial consumer adoption of Tesla vehicles, as the tax credits given by governments enabled Tesla's battery electric vehicles to be price-competitive, in comparison with existing lower-priced internal combustion engine vehicles.\n",

He posts memes, promotes business interests, and comments on contemporary political and cultural issues. Musk's statements have provoked controversy, such as for mocking preferred gender pronouns, and comparing Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau to Adolf Hitler. The New York Times describes his contributions to international relations as \"chaotic\", and critics of Musk argue that there is a lack of separation between his opinions and his business interests. As CEO of Twitter, Musk emerged as a source of misinformation, for example by suggesting online details about mass murderer Mauricio Garcia's apparent interest in Nazism could have been planted as part of a psyop. Allegations of him being transphobic appeared as well in response to actions taken by Twitter under his guidance. The Israel government and several media outlets accused Musk of antisemitism due to him spreading George Soros conspiracy theories, although some Israeli officials defended Musk.\n",

      "The child was eventually named X AE A-XII Musk, with \"X\" as a first name, \"AE A-XII\" as a middle name, and \"Musk\" as surname.In December 2021, Grimes and Musk had a second child, a daughter named Exa Dark Sideræl Musk (nicknamed \"Y\"), born via surrogacy.Despite the pregnancy, Musk confirmed reports that the couple were \"semi-separated\" in September 2021; in an interview with Time in December 2021, he said he was single.In March 2022, Grimes said of her relationship with Musk: \"I would probably refer to him as my boyfriend, but we're very fluid.\"Later that month, Grimes tweeted that she and Musk had broken up again but remained on good terms.In July 2022, Insider published court documents revealing that Musk had had twins with Shivon Zilis, director of operations and special projects at Neuralink, in November 2021.They were born weeks before Musk and Grimes had their second child via surrogate in December.The news \"raise[d] questions about workplace ethics\", given that Zilis directly reported to Musk.\n",

      "After Jordan received word of his acceptance into the Hall of Fame, he selected Class of 1996 member David Thompson to present him.As Jordan would later explain during his induction speech in September 2009, he was not a fan of the Tar Heels when growing up in North Carolina but greatly admired Thompson, who played for the rival NC State Wolfpack.In September, he was inducted into the Hall with several former Bulls teammates in attendance, including Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman, Charles Oakley, Ron Harper, Steve Kerr, and Toni Kukoč.Dean Smith and Doug Collins, two of Jordan's former coaches, were also among those present.His emotional reaction during his speech when he began to cry was captured by Associated Press photographer Stephan Savoia and would later go viral on social media as the \"Crying Jordan\" Internet meme.In 2016, President Barack Obama honored Jordan with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.In October 2021, Jordan was named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.In September 2022, Jordan's jersey in which he played the opening game of the 1998 NBA Finals was sold for $10.1 million, making it the most expensive game-worn sports memorabilia in history.\n",
      "Awards for his contributions to the development of the Falcon rockets include the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics George Low Transportation Award in 2008, the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale Gold Space Medal in 2010, and the Royal Aeronautical Society Gold Medal in 2012.Time has listed Musk as one of the most influential people in the world on four occasions in 2010, 2013, 2018, and 2021.Musk was selected as Time's \"Person of the Year\" for 2021.Time editor-in-chief Edward Felsenthal wrote that \"Person of the Year is a marker of influence, and few individuals have had more influence than Musk on life on Earth, and potentially life off Earth too\".In February 2022, Musk was elected as a member of the National Academy of Engineering.\n",

      "His mother, Maye Musk (née Haldeman), is a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada, and raised in South Africa.His father, Errol Musk, is a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, and property developer, who partly owned a Zambian emerald mine near Lake Tanganyika.Musk has a younger brother, Kimbal, and a younger sister, Tosca.Musk's family was wealthy during his youth.His father was elected to the Pretoria City Council as a representative of the anti-apartheid Progressive Party and has said that his children shared their father's dislike of apartheid.His maternal grandfather, Joshua Haldeman, was an American-born Canadian who took his family on record-breaking journeys to Africa and Australia in a single-engine Bellanca airplane.After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk chose to live primarily with his father.Musk later regretted his decision and became estranged from his father.He has a paternal half-sister and a half-brother.Maye Musk has said of her son that he \"was shy and awkward at school\" and \"didn't have many friends\".\n",
      "He holds the NBA records for career regular season scoring average (30.1 points per game) and career playoff scoring average (33.4 points per game).In 1999, he was named the 20th century's greatest North American athlete by ESPN and was second to Babe Ruth on the Associated Press' list of athletes of the century.Jordan was twice inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, once in 2009 for his individual career, and again in 2010 as part of the 1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team (\"The Dream Team\").He became a member of the United States Olympic Hall of Fame in 2009, a member of the North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame in 2010, and an individual member of the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2015 and a \"Dream Team\" member in 2017.In 2021, he was named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.One of the most effectively marketed athletes of his generation, Jordan is known for his product endorsements.He fueled the success of Nike's Air Jordan sneakers, which were introduced in 1984 and remain popular today.\n",
      "This included about $12.5 billion in loans against his Tesla stock and $21 billion in equity financing.Tesla's stock market value sank by over $100 billion the next day in reaction to the deal, causing Musk to lose around $30 billion of his net worth.He subsequently tweeted criticism of Twitter executive Vijaya Gadde's policies to his 86 million followers, which led to some of them engaging in sexist and racist harassment against her.Exactly a month after announcing the takeover, Musk stated that the deal was \"on hold\" following a report that 5% of Twitter's daily active users were spam accounts, causing Twitter shares to drop more than 10 percent.Although he initially affirmed his commitment to the acquisition, he sent notification of his termination of the deal in July; Twitter's Board of Directors responded that they were committed to holding him to the transaction.On July 12, 2022, Twitter formally sued Musk in the Chancery Court of Delaware for breaching a legally binding agreement to purchase Twitter.In October 2022, Musk reversed again, offering to purchase Twitter at $54.20 per share.\n",
      "Coincidentally, Jordan and the Bulls met Barkley and his Phoenix Suns in the 1993 NBA Finals.The Bulls won their third NBA championship on a game-winning shot by John Paxson and a last-second block by Horace Grant, but Jordan was once again Chicago's leader.He averaged a Finals-record 41.0 ppg during the six-game series, and became the first player in NBA history to win three straight Finals MVP awards.He scored more than 30 points in every game of the series, including 40 or more points in four consecutive games.With his third Finals triumph, Jordan capped off a seven-year run where he attained seven scoring titles and three championships, but there were signs that Jordan was tiring of his massive celebrity and all of the non-basketball hassles in his life.\n",

      "==== Gambling ====\n",
      "During the Bulls' 1993 NBA playoffs, Jordan was seen gambling in Atlantic City, New Jersey, the night before Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the New York Knicks.\n",
      "The previous year, he admitted that he had to cover $57,000 in gambling losses, and author Richard Esquinas wrote a book in 1993 claiming he had won $1.25 million from Jordan on the golf course.David Stern, the commissioner of the NBA, denied in 1995 and 2006 that Jordan's 1993 retirement was a secret suspension by the league for gambling, but the rumor spread widely.In 2005, Jordan discussed his gambling with Ed Bradley of 60 Minutes and admitted that he made reckless decisions.Jordan stated: \"Yeah, I've gotten myself into situations where I would not walk away and I've pushed the envelope.Is that compulsive?Yeah, it depends on how you look at it.If you're willing to jeopardize your livelihood and your family, then yeah.\"When Bradley asked him if his gambling ever got to the level where it jeopardized his livelihood or family, Jordan replied: \"No.\"In 2010, Ron Shelton, director of Jordan Rides the Bus, said that he began working on the documentary believing that the NBA had suspended him, but that research \"convinced [him it] was nonsense\".\n",
      "The media, hoping to recreate a Magic–Bird rivalry, highlighted the similarities between \"Air\" Jordan and Clyde \"The Glide\" during the pre-Finals hype.In the first game, Jordan scored a Finals-record 35 points in the first half, including a record-setting six three-point field goals.After the sixth three-pointer, he jogged down the court shrugging as he looked courtside.Marv Albert, who broadcast the game, later stated that it was as if Jordan was saying: \"I can't believe I'm doing this.\"The Bulls went on to win Game 1 and defeat the Blazers in six games.Jordan was named Finals MVP for the second year in a row, and finished the series averaging 35.8 ppg, 4.8 rpg, and 6.5 apg, while shooting 52.6% from the floor.In the 1992–93 season, despite a 32.6 ppg, 6.7 rpg, and 5.5 apg campaign, including a second-place finish in Defensive Player of the Year voting, Jordan's streak of consecutive MVP seasons ended, as he lost the award to his friend Charles Barkley, which upset him.\n",
      "While this resulted in saved costs for SpaceX's rocket, vertical integration has caused many usability problems for Tesla's software.Musk's handling of employees—whom he communicates with directly through mass emails—has been characterized as \"carrot and stick\", rewarding those \"who offer constructive criticism\" while also being known to impulsively threaten, swear at, and fire his employees.Musk said he expects his employees to work for long hours, sometimes for 80 hours per week.He has his new employees sign strict non-disclosure agreements and often fires in sprees, such as during the Model 3 \"production hell\" in 2018.In 2022, Musk revealed plans to fire 10 percent of Tesla's workforce, due to his concerns about the economy.That same month, he suspended remote work at SpaceX and Tesla and threatened to fire employees who do not work 40 hours per week in the office.Musk's leadership has been praised by some, who credit it with the success of Tesla and his other endeavors, and criticized by others, who see him as callous and his managerial decisions as \"show[ing] a lack of human understanding.\"The 2021 book Power Play contains anecdotes of Musk berating employees.\n",
      "As a senior, he was selected to play in the 1981 McDonald's All-American Game and scored 30 points, after averaging 27 ppg, 12 rebounds (rpg), and six assists per game (apg) for the season.He was recruited by numerous college basketball programs, including Duke, North Carolina, South Carolina, Syracuse, and Virginia.In 1981, he accepted a basketball scholarship to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he majored in cultural geography.\n",
      "=== 2018 Joe Rogan podcast appearance ===\n",
      "In 2018, Musk appeared on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast and discussed various topics for over two hours. During the interview, Musk sampled a puff from a cigar consisting, the host claimed, of tobacco laced with cannabis. Tesla stock dropped after the incident, which coincided with the confirmation of the departure of Tesla's vice president of worldwide finance earlier that day. Fortune wondered if the cannabis use could have ramifications for SpaceX contracts with the United States Air Force, though an Air Force spokesperson told The Verge that there was no investigation and that the Air Force was still determining the facts. In 2022, Musk claimed that he and other Space-X employees were subjected to random drug tests for about a year following the incident. In a 60 Minutes interview, Musk said of the incident: \"I do not smoke pot. As anybody who watched that podcast could tell, I have no idea how to smoke pot.\"\n",
      "=== Private jet ===\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2003, Musk said his favorite plane he owned was an L-39 Albatros. He uses a private jet owned by Falcon Landing LLC, a SpaceX-linked company, and acquired a second jet in August 2020. His heavy use of the jet—it flew over 150,000 miles in 2018—and the consequent fossil fuel usage has received criticism.His flight usage is tracked on social media through ElonJet. The Twitter version of the account was blocked in December 2022, after Musk claimed that his son X AE A-XII had been harassed by a stalker after the account posted the airport at which his jet had landed. This led to Musk banning the ElonJet account on Twitter, as well as the accounts of journalists that posted stories regarding the incident, including Donie O'Sullivan, Keith Olbermann, and journalists from The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN, and The Intercept. Musk equated the reporting to doxxing. The police do not believe there is a link between the account and alleged stalker. Musk later took a Twitter poll on whether the journalists' accounts should be reinstated, which resulted in reinstating the accounts.\n",
      "\"Although Jordan was a well-rounded player, his \"Air Jordan\" image is also often credited with inadvertently decreasing the jump shooting skills, defense, and fundamentals of young players, a fact Jordan himself has lamented, saying: \"I think it was the exposure of Michael Jordan; the marketing of Michael Jordan.Everything was marketed towards the things that people wanted to see, which was scoring and dunking.That Michael Jordan still played defense and an all-around game, but it was never really publicized.\"During his heyday, Jordan did much to increase the status of the game; television ratings increased only during his time in the league.The popularity of the NBA in the U.S. declined after his last title.As late as 2022, NBA Finals television ratings had not returned to the level reached during his last championship-winning season.In August 2009, the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts, opened a Michael Jordan exhibit that contained items from his college and NBA careers as well as from the 1992 \"Dream Team\"; the exhibit also has a batting baseball glove to signify Jordan's short career in the Minor League Baseball.\n",
      "Jordan finished among the top three in regular season MVP voting 10 times.He was named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996, and selected to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021.Jordan is one of only seven players in history to win an NCAA championship, an NBA championship, and an Olympic gold medal (doing so twice with the 1984 and 1992 U.S. men's basketball teams).Since 1976, the year of the ABA–NBA merger, Jordan and Pippen are the only two players to win six NBA Finals playing for one team.In the All-Star Game fan ballot, Jordan received the most votes nine times, more than any other player.Many of Jordan's contemporaries have said that Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time.In 1999, an ESPN survey of journalists, athletes and other sports figures ranked Jordan the greatest North American athlete of the 20th century, above Babe Ruth and Muhammad Ali.Jordan placed second to Ruth in the Associated Press' December 1999 list of 20th century athletes.In addition, the Associated Press voted him the greatest basketball player of the 20th century.Jordan has also appeared on the front cover of Sports Illustrated a record 50 times.\n",
      "James Jr. became command sergeant major of the 35th Signal Brigade of the U.S. Army's XVIII Airborne Corps and retired in 2006.In 1968, Jordan moved with his family to Wilmington, North Carolina.He attended Emsley A. Laney High School in Wilmington, where he highlighted his athletic career by playing basketball, baseball, and football.He tried out for the basketball varsity team during his sophomore year, but at a height of 5 feet 11 inches (1.80 m), he was deemed too short to play at that level.His taller friend Harvest Leroy Smith was the only sophomore to make the team.Motivated to prove his worth, Jordan became the star of Laney's junior varsity team and tallied some 40-point games.The following summer, he grew four inches (10 cm) and trained rigorously.Upon earning a spot on the varsity roster, he averaged more than 25 points per game (ppg) over his final two seasons of high school play.\n",

      "He spread misinformation about the virus, including promoting a widely discredited paper on the benefits of chloroquine and claiming that COVID-19 death statistics were inflated.In March 2020, Musk stated, \"The coronavirus panic is dumb.\"In an email to Tesla employees, Musk referred to COVID-19 as a \"specific form of the common cold\" and predicted that confirmed COVID-19 cases would not exceed 0.1% of the U.S. population.On March 19, 2020, Musk predicted that there would be \"probably close to zero new cases in [the U.S.] by end of April\".Politico labeled this statement one of \"the most audacious, confident, and spectacularly incorrect prognostications [of 2020]\".Musk also claimed falsely that children \"are essentially immune\" to COVID-19.Musk condemned COVID-19 lockdowns and initially refused to close the Tesla Fremont Factory in March 2020, defying the local shelter-in-place order.\n",
      "Under Musk, Tesla has also constructed multiple lithium-ion battery and electric vehicle factories, named Gigafactories.Since its initial public offering in 2010, Tesla stock has risen significantly; it became the most valuable carmaker in summer 2020, and it entered the S&P 500 later that year.In October 2021, it reached a market capitalization of $1 trillion, the sixth company in U.S. history to do so.In November 2021, Musk proposed, on Twitter, to sell 10% of his Tesla stock, since \"much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance\".After more than 3.5 million Twitter accounts supported the sale, Musk sold $6.9 billion of Tesla stock within a week, and a total of $16.4 billion by year end, reaching the 10% target.In February 2022, The Wall Street Journal reported that both Elon and Kimbal Musk were under investigation by the SEC for possible insider trading related to the sale.In 2022, Musk unveiled a robot developed by Tesla, Optimus.\n",
      "During his rookie 1984–85 season with the Bulls, Jordan averaged 28.2 ppg on 51.5% shooting, and helped make a team that had won 35% of games in the previous three seasons playoff contenders.He quickly became a fan favorite even in opposing arenas.Roy S. Johnson of The New York Times described him as \"the phenomenal rookie of the Bulls\" in November, and Jordan appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated with the heading \"A Star Is Born\" in December.The fans also voted in Jordan as an All-Star starter during his rookie season.Controversy arose before the 1985 NBA All-Star Game when word surfaced that several veteran players, led by Isiah Thomas, were upset by the amount of attention Jordan was receiving.This led to a so-called \"freeze-out\" on Jordan, where players refused to pass the ball to him throughout the game.The controversy left Jordan relatively unaffected when he returned to regular season play, and he would go on to be voted the NBA Rookie of the Year.\n",
      "The acquisition was officially completed on October 27.Immediately after the acquisition, Musk fired several top Twitter executives including CEO Parag Agrawal; Musk became the CEO instead.He instituted a $7.99 monthly subscription for a \"blue check\", and laid off a significant portion of the company's staff.Musk lessened content moderation, and in December, Musk released internal documents relating to Twitter's moderation of Hunter Biden's laptop controversy in the leadup to the 2020 presidential election.The Southern Poverty Law Center noted that Twitter has verified numerous extremists, and a study of millions of tweets following the acquisition indicated that hate speech on the platform has become \"more visible\" under Musk's leadership.Within the first weeks of ownership, Musk made a series of decisions and changes that he quickly reversed, including the paid blue checkmark, creating an \"official\" label and forbidding linking to one's profiles on other social media platforms.Under Musk's management, Twitter experienced several large scale outages.In April 2022, The Washington Post reported that Musk privately claimed that supposed censorship on the platform, including the banning of accounts such as The Babylon Bee, had prompted him to begin the acquisition.\n",
      "Musk also promoted a baseless theory relating to the attack of Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband, but Musk deleted his tweet.Musk has praised China and has been described as having a close relationship with the Chinese government, allowing access to its markets for Tesla.After Gigafactory Shanghai produced its first batch of vehicles, Musk thanked the Chinese government and Chinese people while criticizing the United States and its people.: 207–208  In 2022, Musk wrote an article for China Cyberspace, the official publication of Cyberspace Administration of China, which enforces Internet censorship in China.His writing the article was described as conflicting with his advocacy for free speech.Musk later advocated for Taiwan to become a \"special administrative zone\" of China which drew cross-party criticism from Taiwanese lawmakers.In October 2022, Musk posted a Twitter poll and \"peace plan\" to resolve the Russian invasion of Ukraine.It was reported that Musk allegedly spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin prior to the proposal, which Musk denied.\n",

      "Jordan has had a long relationship with Gatorade, appearing in over 20 commercials for the company since 1991, including the \"Be Like Mike\" commercials in which a song was sung by children wishing to be like Jordan.Nike created a signature shoe for Jordan, called the Air Jordan, in 1984.One of Jordan's more popular commercials for the shoe involved Spike Lee playing the part of Mars Blackmon.In the commercials, Lee, as Blackmon, attempted to find the source of Jordan's abilities and became convinced that \"it's gotta be the shoes\".The hype and demand for the shoes even brought on a spate of \"shoe-jackings\", in which people were robbed of their sneakers at gunpoint.Subsequently, Nike spun off the Jordan line into its own division named the \"Jordan Brand\".The company features a list of athletes and celebrities as endorsers.The brand has also sponsored college sports programs such as those of North Carolina, UCLA, California, Oklahoma, Florida, Georgetown, and Marquette.Jordan also has been associated with the Looney Tunes cartoon characters.A Nike commercial shown during 1992's Super Bowl XXVI featured Jordan and Bugs Bunny playing basketball.\n",
      "Accordingly, Musk has stated that artificial intelligence poses the greatest existential threat to humanity.He has warned of a \"Terminator-like\" AI apocalypse and suggested that the government should regulate its safe development.In 2015, Musk was a cosignatory, along with Stephen Hawking and hundreds of others, of the Open Letter on Artificial Intelligence, which called for the ban of autonomous weapons.Musk's AI stances have been called alarmist and sensationalist by critics such as computer scientist Yann LeCun and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and led the think tank Information Technology and Innovation Foundation to award Musk its Annual Luddite Award in 2016.Musk has described climate change as the greatest threat to humanity after AI, and has advocated for a carbon tax.Musk was a critic of President Donald Trump's stance on climate change, and resigned from two presidential business advisory councils following Trump's 2017 decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement.Musk has long promoted the colonization of Mars and argues that humanity should become a \"multiplanetary species\".He has suggested the use of nuclear weapons to terraform Mars.\n",
      "In 2022, he acquired Twitter for $44 billion and subsequently merged the company into newly created X Corp. and rebranded the service as X the following year.In March 2023, he founded xAI, an artificial-intelligence company.Musk has expressed views that have made him a polarizing figure.He has been criticized for making unscientific and misleading statements, including that of spreading COVID-19 misinformation, and promoting conspiracy theories.His Twitter ownership has been similarly controversial, including letting off a large number of employees, an increase in hate speech on the platform and features such as Twitter Blue and the implementation of limits on the amount of viewable Tweets per day being criticized.In 2018, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued him for falsely tweeting that he had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla.To settle the case, Musk stepped down as the chairman of Tesla and paid a $20 million fine.\n",

      "Jordan made his debut for the U.S. national basketball team at the 1983 Pan American Games in Caracas, Venezuela.He led the team in scoring with 17.3 ppg as the U.S., coached by Jack Hartman, won the gold medal in the competition.A year later, he won another gold medal in the 1984 Summer Olympics.The 1984 U.S. team was coached by Bob Knight and featured players such as Patrick Ewing, Sam Perkins, Chris Mullin, Steve Alford, and Wayman Tisdale.Jordan led the team in scoring, averaging 17.1 ppg for the tournament.In 1992, Jordan was a member of the star-studded squad that was dubbed the \"Dream Team\", which included Larry Bird and Magic Johnson.The team went on to win two gold medals: the first one in the 1992 Tournament of the Americas, and the second one in the 1992 Summer Olympics.He was the only player to start all eight games in the Olympics, averaged 14.9 ppg, and finished second on the team in scoring.\n",

      "During the season, Sam Vincent, Chicago's point guard, was having trouble running the offense, and Jordan expressed his frustration with head coach Doug Collins, who would put Jordan at point guard.In his time as a point guard, Jordan averaged 10 triple-doubles in eleven games, with 33.6 ppg, 11.4 rpg, 10.8 apg, 2.9 spg, and 0.8 bpg on 51% shooting.The Bulls finished with a 47–35 record, and advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals, defeating the Cavaliers and New York Knicks along the way.The Cavaliers series included a career highlight for Jordan when he hit \"The Shot\" over Craig Ehlo at the buzzer in the fifth and final game of the series.\n",

      "Though the rocket failed to reach Earth orbit, it was awarded a Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program contract from NASA Administrator (and former SpaceX consultant) Mike Griffin later that year.After two more failed attempts that nearly caused Musk and his companies to go bankrupt, SpaceX succeeded in launching the Falcon 1 into orbit in 2008.Later that year, SpaceX received a $1.6 billion Commercial Resupply Services contract from NASA for 12 flights of its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft to the International Space Station, replacing the Space Shuttle after its 2011 retirement.In 2012, the Dragon vehicle docked with the ISS, a first for a commercial spacecraft.Working towards its goal of reusable rockets, in 2015 SpaceX successfully landed the first stage of a Falcon 9 on an inland platform.Later landings were achieved on autonomous spaceport drone ships, an ocean-based recovery platform.In 2018, SpaceX launched the Falcon Heavy; the inaugural mission carried Musk's personal Tesla Roadster as a dummy payload.Since 2019, SpaceX has been developing Starship, a fully-reusable, super-heavy-lift launch vehicle intended to replace the Falcon 9 and the Falcon Heavy.\n",

      "==== SolarCity and Tesla Energy ====\n",

      "Musk provided the initial concept and financial capital for SolarCity, which his cousins Lyndon and Peter Rive founded in 2006. By 2013, SolarCity was the second largest provider of solar power systems in the United States. In 2014, Musk promoted the idea of SolarCity building an advanced production facility in Buffalo, New York, triple the size of the largest solar plant in the United States. Construction of the factory started in 2014 and was completed in 2017. It operated as a joint venture with Panasonic until early 2020.Tesla acquired SolarCity for over $2 billion in 2016 and merged it with its battery unit to create Tesla Energy. The deal's announcement resulted in a more than 10% drop in Tesla's stock price. At the time, SolarCity was facing liquidity issues. Multiple shareholder groups filed a lawsuit against Musk and Tesla's directors, claiming that the purchase of SolarCity was done solely to benefit Musk and came at the expense of Tesla and its shareholders. Tesla directors settled the lawsuit in January 2020, leaving Musk the sole remaining defendant. Two years later, the court ruled in Musk's favor.\n",

      "On January 19, 2000, Jordan returned to the NBA not as a player but as part owner and president of basketball operations for the Washington Wizards.Jordan's responsibilities with the Wizards were comprehensive, as he controlled all aspects of the Wizards' basketball operations, and had the final say in all personnel matters; opinions of Jordan as a basketball executive were mixed.He managed to purge the team of several highly paid, unpopular players (like forward Juwan Howard and point guard Rod Strickland) but used the first pick in the 2001 NBA draft to select high school student Kwame Brown, who did not live up to expectations and was traded away after four seasons.Despite his January 1999 claim that he was \"99.9% certain\" he would never play another NBA game, Jordan expressed interest in making another comeback in the summer of 2001, this time with his new team.Inspired by the NHL comeback of his friend Mario Lemieux the previous winter, Jordan spent much of the spring and summer of 2001 in training, holding several invitation-only camps for NBA players in Chicago.\n",
      "In February 2023, the jury found Musk and Tesla not liable.In 2019, Musk stated in a tweet that Tesla would build half a million cars that year.The SEC reacted to Musk's tweet by filing in court, asking the court to hold him in contempt for violating the terms of a settlement agreement with such a tweet; the accusation was disputed by Musk.This was eventually settled by a joint agreement between Musk and the SEC clarifying the previous agreement details.The agreement included a list of topics that Musk would need preclearance before tweeting about.In 2020, a judge prevented a lawsuit from proceeding that claimed a tweet by Musk regarding Tesla stock price (\"too high imo\") violated the agreement.FOIA-released records showed that the SEC itself concluded Musk has subsequently violated the agreement twice by tweeting regarding \"Tesla's solar roof production volumes and its stock price\".\n",

On May 7, 2003, Wizards owner Abe Pollin fired Jordan as the team's president of basketball operations. Jordan later stated that he felt betrayed, and that if he had known he would be fired upon retiring, he never would have come back to play for the Wizards.Jordan kept busy over the next few years. He stayed in shape, played golf in celebrity charity tournaments, and spent time with his family in Chicago. He also promoted his Jordan Brand clothing line and rode motorcycles.

Since then, OpenAI has made significant advances in machine learning, producing neural networks such as GPT-3 (producing human-like text), and DALL-E (generating digital images from natural language descriptions).\n",
      "Jordan's effective field goal percentage was 50%, and he had six seasons with at least 50% shooting, five of which consecutively (1988–1992); he also shot 51% and 50%, and 30% and 33% from the three-point range, throughout his first and second retirements, respectively, finishing his Chicago Bulls career with 31.5 points per game on 50.5 FG% shooting and his overall career with 49.7 FG% shooting.Unlike NBA players often compared to Jordan, such as Kobe Bryant and LeBron James, who had a similar three-point percentage, he did not shoot as many threes as they did, as he did not need to rely on the three-pointer in order to be effective on offense.Three-point shooting was only introduced in 1979 and would not be a more fundamental aspect of the game until the first decades of the 21st century, with the NBA having to briefly shorten the line to incentivize more shots.Jordan's three-point shooting was better selected, resulting in three-point field goals made in important games during the playoffs and the Finals, such as hitting six consecutive three-point shots in Game 1 of the 1992 NBA Finals.\n",

      "In 2017, Musk founded the Boring Company to construct tunnels, and revealed plans for specialized, underground, high-occupancy vehicles that could travel up to 150 miles per hour (240 km/h) and thus circumvent above-ground traffic in major cities. Early in 2017, the company began discussions with regulatory bodies and initiated construction of a 30-foot (9.1 m) wide, 50-foot (15 m) long, and 15-foot (4.6 m) deep \"test trench\" on the premises of SpaceX's offices, as that required no permits. The Los Angeles tunnel, less than two miles (3.2 km) in length, debuted to journalists in 2018. It used Tesla Model Xs and was reported to be a rough ride while traveling at suboptimal speeds.Two tunnel projects announced in 2018, in Chicago and West Los Angeles, have been canceled. However, a tunnel beneath the Las Vegas Convention Center was completed in early 2021. Local officials have approved further expansions of the tunnel system. In 2021, tunnel construction was approved for Fort Lauderdale, Florida.\n",
