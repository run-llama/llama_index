    "# Comparing Methods for Structured Retrieval (Auto-Retrieval vs. Recursive Retrieval)\n",
    "\n",
    "In a naive RAG system, the set of input documents are then chunked, embedded, and dumped to a vector database collection. Retrieval would just fetch the top-k documents by embedding similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can fail if the set of documents is large - it can be hard to disambiguate raw chunks, and you're not guaranteed to filter for the set of documents that contain relevant context.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide we explore **structured retrieval** - more advanced query algorithms that take advantage of structure within your documents for higher-precision retrieval. We compare the following two methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Metadata Filters + Auto-Retrieval**: Tag each document with the right set of metadata. During query-time, use auto-retrieval to infer metadata filters along with passing through the query string for semantic search.\n",
    "- **Store Document Hierarchies (summaries -> raw chunks) + Recursive Retrieval**: Embed document summaries and map that to the set of raw chunks for each document. During query-time, do recursive retrieval to first fetch summaries before fetching documents."

He has been described as an eccentric who makes spontaneous and controversial statements, contrary to other billionaires who prefer reclusiveness to protect their businesses. Vance described people's opinions of Musk as polarized due to his \"part philosopher, part troll\" role on Twitter.Musk was a partial inspiration for the characterization of Tony Stark in the Marvel film Iron Man (2008). Musk also had a cameo appearance in the film's 2010 sequel, Iron Man 2. Musk has made cameos and appearances in other films such as Machete Kills (2013), Why Him? (2016), and Men in Black: International (2019).
