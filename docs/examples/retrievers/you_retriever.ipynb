      "Renewable Energy Costs To Fall Further. Yes, the cost of investing in renewable energy projects will continue its downward trend this year. Notably, wind and solar power will go further lower as cost competitiveness remains the defining characteristic of renewable energy sources.\n",
      "In 2024, for instance, 91 percent of all newly commissioned utility-scale renewable projects delivered electricity at a lower cost than the cheapest new fossil fuel-fired alternative, according to findings of a study by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).\n",
      "At the heart of its increased adoption will be strong economics, technological advancements, and a push for energy security and sovereignty, especially in Africa, where 600 million people live in the dark and cold. In many parts of the world, new renewable energy projects are already cheaper than fossil fuel alternatives....\n",
