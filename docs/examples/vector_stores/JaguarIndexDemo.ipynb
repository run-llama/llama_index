    "# Jaguar Vector Store\n",
    "\n",
    "This document demonstrates llama_index working with Jaguar vector store.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is a distributed vector database that can store large number of vectors.\n",
    "- The ZeroMove feature enables instant horizontal scaling.\n",
    "- It supports embeddings, text, images, videos, PDFs, audio, time series, and spatial data. \n",
    "- The all-master architecture allows both parallel reads and writes.\n",
    "- Its anomaly detection capabilities can distinguish outliers in the dataset.\n",
    "- The RAG support can combine LLMs and proprietary and real-time data.\n",
    "- Sharing of metadata across multiple vector indexes improves data consistency.\n",
    "- Distance metrics include Euclidean, Cosine, InnerProduct, Manhatten, Chebyshev, Hamming, Jeccard, and Minkowski.\n",
    "- Similarity search can be performed with time cutoff and time decay effects.\n",
    "\n",

The pod is the Pod (or database) name. The store is the name of the vector store. A pod may have multiple stores. The vector_index is the name of the vector index in the store. A store may have multiple vector indexes. The store client object is, however, bound to one vector index only. The vector_type specifies the attributes of the vector index. In the string \"cosine_fraction_short\", cosine means that the distance between two vectors is computed with the cosine distance. Fraction means the vector components are fractional numbers. Short means the storage format of the vector components is a short integer of signed 16-bits integers. Storage format could be float of 32-bit floating point numbers. It can also be a byte of 8-bit signed integers. The vector_dimension is the dimension of the vector generated by the provided embedding model."
