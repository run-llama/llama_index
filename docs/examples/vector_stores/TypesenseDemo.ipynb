He also experienced the exponential growth of commodity processors in the 1990s, which rolled up high-end, special-purpose hardware and software companies. He also learned how to make a little Italian go a long way by stringing together abstract concepts with a few simple verbs. He also experienced the tight coupling of money and coolness in the art world, and the fact that anything expensive comes to be seen as cool, and anything seen as cool will soon become equally expensive. He also experienced the challenge of launching software, as he had to recruit an initial set of users and make sure they had decent-looking stores before launching publicly. He also experienced the first instance of what is now a familiar experience, when he read the comments and found they were full of angry people. He also experienced the difference between putting something online and publishing it online. Finally, he wrote essays about topics he had stacked up, and wrote a more detailed version for others to read.</b>"
