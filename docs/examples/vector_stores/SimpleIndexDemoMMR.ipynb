    "This notebook explores the use of MMR retrieval [<a href=\"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jgc/publication/The_Use_MMR_Diversity_Based_LTMIR_1998.pdf\">1</a>]. By using maximum marginal relevance, one can iteratively find documents that are dissimilar to previous results. It has been shown to improve performance for LLM retrievals [<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.13892.pdf\">2</a>]. \n",
    "\n",
    "The maximum marginal relevance algorithm is as follows:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{{MMR}} = \\arg\\max_{d_i \\in D \\setminus R} [ \\lambda \\cdot Sim_1(d_i, q) - (1 - \\lambda) \\cdot \\max_{d_j \\in R} Sim_2(d_i, d_j) ]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, D is the set of all candidate documents, R is the set of already selected documents, q is the query, $Sim_1$ is the similarity function between a document and the query, and $Sim_2$ is the similarity function between two documents. $d_i$ and $d_j$ are documents in D and R respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameter Î» (mmr_threshold) controls the trade-off between relevance (the first term) and diversity (the second term). If mmr_threshold is close to 1, more emphasis is put on relevance, while a mmr_threshold close to 0 puts more emphasis on diversity."

But when you find yourself drawn to some kind of work despite its current lack of prestige, it's a sign both that there's something real to be discovered there, and that you have the right kind of motives. Impure motives are a big danger for the ambitious. If anything is going to lead you astray, it will be the desire to impress people. So while working on things that aren't prestigious doesn't guarantee you're on the right track, it at least guarantees you're not on the most common type of wrong one.\n",
