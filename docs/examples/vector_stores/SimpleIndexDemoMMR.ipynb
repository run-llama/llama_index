    "This notebook explores the use of MMR retrieval [<a href=\"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jgc/publication/The_Use_MMR_Diversity_Based_LTMIR_1998.pdf\">1</a>]. By using maximum marginal relevance, one can iteratively find documents that are dissimilar to previous results. It has been shown to improve performance for LLM retrievals [<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.13892.pdf\">2</a>]. \n",
    "\n",
    "The maximum marginal relevance algorithm is as follows:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{{MMR}} = \\arg\\max_{d_i \\in D \\setminus R} [ \\lambda \\cdot Sim_1(d_i, q) - (1 - \\lambda) \\cdot \\max_{d_j \\in R} Sim_2(d_i, d_j) ]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, D is the set of all candidate documents, R is the set of already selected documents, q is the query, $Sim_1$ is the similarity function between a document and the query, and $Sim_2$ is the similarity function between two documents. $d_i$ and $d_j$ are documents in D and R respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameter λ (mmr_threshold) controls the trade-off between relevance (the first term) and diversity (the second term). If mmr_threshold is close to 1, more emphasis is put on relevance, while a mmr_threshold close to 0 puts more emphasis on diversity."
