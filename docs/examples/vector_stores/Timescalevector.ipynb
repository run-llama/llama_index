    "## What is Timescale Vector?\n",
    "**[Timescale Vector](https://www.timescale.com/ai) is PostgreSQL++ for AI applications.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Timescale Vector enables you to efficiently store and query billions of vector embeddings in `PostgreSQL`.\n",
    "- Enhances `pgvector` with faster and more accurate similarity search on 1B+ vectors via DiskANN inspired indexing algorithm.\n",
    "- Enables fast time-based vector search via automatic time-based partitioning and indexing.\n",
    "- Provides a familiar SQL interface for querying vector embeddings and relational data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Timescale Vector scales with you from POC to production:\n",
    "- Simplifies operations by enabling you to store relational metadata, vector embeddings, and time-series data in a single database.\n",
    "- Benefits from rock-solid PostgreSQL foundation with enterprise-grade feature liked streaming backups and replication, high-availability and row-level security.\n",
    "- Enables a worry-free experience with enterprise-grade security and compliance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to use Timescale Vector\n",
    "Timescale Vector is available on [Timescale](https://www.timescale.com/products), the cloud PostgreSQL platform. (There is no self-hosted version at this time.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- LlamaIndex users get a 90-day free trial for Timescale Vector.\n",
    "- To get started, [signup](https://console.cloud.timescale.com/signup) to Timescale, create a new database and follow this notebook!\n",
    "- See the [installation instructions](https://github.com/timescale/python-vector) for more details on using Timescale Vector in python."

It means that even two different Continuous Aggregates over two different hypertables will wait each other in the first phase of the refreshing procedure. Also it lead to problems when a pg_dump is running because it take an AccessShareLock on tables so Continuous Aggregate refresh execution will wait until the pg_dump finish.  Improved it by relaxing the strong table-level lock to a row-level lock so now the Continuous Aggregate refresh procedure can be executed in multiple sessions with less locks.  Fix #3554\n",

      "Mon Aug 28 15:32:54 2023 +0200 Sven Klemm Move log invalidation functions to _timescaledb_functions schema To increase schema security we do not want to mix our own internal objects with user objects. Since chunks are created in the _timescaledb_internal schema our internal functions should live in a different dedicated schema. This patch make the necessary adjustments for the following functions:  - cagg_watermark(integer) - cagg_watermark_materialized(integer) - hypertable_invalidation_log_delete(integer) - invalidation_cagg_log_add_entry(integer,bigint,bigint) - invalidation_hyper_log_add_entry(integer,bigint,bigint) - invalidation_process_cagg_log(integer,integer,regtype,bigint,bigint,integer[],bigint[],bigint[]) - invalidation_process_cagg_log(integer,integer,regtype,bigint,bigint,integer[],bigint[],bigint[],text[]) - invalidation_process_hypertable_log(integer,integer,regtype,integer[],bigint[],bigint[]) - invalidation_process_hypertable_log(integer,integer,regtype,integer[],bigint[],bigint[],text[]) - materialization_invalidation_log_delete(integer)\n"

It means that even two different Continuous Aggregates over two different hypertables will wait each other in the first phase of the refreshing procedure. Also it lead to problems when a pg_dump is running because it take an AccessShareLock on tables so Continuous Aggregate refresh execution will wait until the pg_dump finish.  Improved it by relaxing the strong table-level lock to a row-level lock so now the Continuous Aggregate refresh procedure can be executed in multiple sessions with less locks.
