    "# Analyze and Debug LlamaIndex Applications with PostHog and Langfuse\n",
    "\n",
    "In this cookbook, we show you how to build a RAG application with [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/), observe the steps with [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/), and analyze the data in [PostHog](https://posthog.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Langfuse?\n",
    "[Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/) is an open-source LLM engineering platform designed to help engineers understand and optimize user interactions with their language model applications. It provides tools for tracking, debugging, and improving LLM performance in real-world use cases. Langfuse is available both as a managed [cloud solution](https://cloud.langfuse.com/) and for [local or self-hosted](https://langfuse.com/docs/deployment/feature-overview) deployments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is PostHog?\n",
    "[PostHog](https://posthog.com/) is a popular choice for product analytics. Combining Langfuse's LLM analytics with PostHog's product analytics makes it easy to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Analyze User Engagement**: Determine how often users interact with specific LLM features and understand their overall activity patterns.\n",
    "- **Correlate Feedback with Behavior**: See how user feedback captured in Langfuse correlates with user behavior in PostHog.\n",
    "- **Monitor LLM Performance**: Track and analyze metrics such as model cost, latency, and user feedback to optimize LLM performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is LlamaIndex?\n",
    "LlamaIndex [(GitHub)](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index) is a data framework designed to connect LLMs with external data sources. It helps structure, index, and query data effectively. This makes it easier for developers to build advanced LLM applications.\n"

All model generations are then traced using Langfuse's [LlamaIndex integration](https://langfuse.com/docs/integrations/llama-index/get-started).\n",
