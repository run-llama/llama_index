# Discover LlamaIndex Video Series

If you like learning from videos, now's a good time to check out our "Discover LlamaIndex" series. If not, we recommend heading on to our [Understanding LlamaIndex](/understanding/understanding.md) tutorial.

## Bottoms-Up Development (Llama Docs Bot)

This is a sub-series within Discover LlamaIndex that shows you how to build a document chatbot from scratch.

We show you how to do this in a "bottoms-up" fashion - start by using the LLMs, data objects as independent modules. Then gradually add higher-level abstractions like indexing, and advanced retrievers/rerankers.
