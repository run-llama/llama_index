Welcome to GPT Index (LlamaIndex 🦙)!
=====================================

GPT Index (LlamaIndex) is a project consisting of a set of data structures designed to make it easier to 
use large external knowledge bases with LLMs.

   ⚠️ **NOTE**: We are rebranding GPT Index as LlamaIndex! We will carry out this transition gradually.

   **2/19/2023**: By default, our docs/notebooks/instructions now use the `llama-index` package. However the `gpt-index` package still exists as a duplicate!

   **2/16/2023**: We have a duplicate `llama-index` pip package. Simply replace all imports of `gpt_index` with `llama_index` if you choose to `pip install llama-index`.

🚀 Overview
-----------

Context
^^^^^^^
- LLMs are a phenomenonal piece of technology for knowledge generation and reasoning.
- A big limitation of LLMs is context size (e.g. Davinci's limit is 4096 tokens. Large, but not infinite).
- The ability to feed "knowledge" to LLMs is restricted to this limited prompt size and model weights.

Proposed Solution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
That's where the **GPT Index** comes in. GPT Index is a simple, flexible interface between your external data and LLMs. It resolves the following pain points:

- Provides simple data structures to resolve prompt size limitations.
- Offers data connectors to your external data sources.
- Offers you a comprehensive toolset trading off cost and performance.

At the core of GPT Index is a **data structure**. Instead of relying on world knowledge encoded in the model weights, a GPT Index data structure does the following:

- Uses a pre-trained LLM primarily for *reasoning*/*summarization* instead of prior knowledge.
- Takes as input a large corpus of text data and build a structured index over it (using an LLM or heuristics).
- Allow users to *query* the index by passing in an LLM prompt, and obtaining a response.
