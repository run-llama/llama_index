Language

Language is a complicated thing to define, especially across a vast and varied multiverse. However, some things remain the same.

Gnomish

Considered by the bards as the most evocative of written languages, it is however rarely used by the general populace. Everyone knows a word or two of it, though, and most ancient records are written in this curious tongue. To think that the greatest invention of the gnomes was to be the most elegant language of them all!

"The language of the bards, soft and flexible!"

Common

Spoken by just about anyone across the many realms, it is said to be somewhat guttural and sharp, compared to the softer tones of Gnomish. It has a particular tonality, which non-native speakers refer to as "sing-songy".

"Jeg ønsker å rulle for perception." (I wish to roll for perception. A common mix of gnomish and common words.)

Orcish

Close to Common, and clearly developed from the same dialect. Words are more clearly spoken, emphasising vowels.

"Æ RÆIGJE" (I am furious)

Undercommon

A flamboyant and sharp language, with an almost melodic aspect. Rough to speak and listen to.

"Forztår du ingenting? Jeg errr Prrrins Ycaaauron!" (Don't you understand anything? I am Prince Ycaron!)

Elvish

Similiar in many ways to Common, but less sharp. Consonants are usually much softer, the speech slower and more refined.

"Tillad mig at tale med dig, ærede Far Konge" (Permit me to speak to you, honoured Father King)
