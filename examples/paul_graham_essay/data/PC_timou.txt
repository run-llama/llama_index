Timou Grolsch

Affiliation: The Trifecta
Warrior
Dwarf
Male

The Grolsch are Trifectan middle class loyals who’s sweat, blood and craftsmanship are literally part of The Line.
Although Timou is a Grolsch of no particular importance, he was in recent years sent to Soskni to train as a fighter (Runic Knight). Having a Grolsch formally trained previously unheard of, however three reasons drove the family to invest in his education.

Scores of his siblings have died from some work-, gamble- or squabble related incidents along The Line. This is an ongoing threat to the family line.
Timou is well known for his work ethics, clear intentions and unwavering decision making. He is an uncomplicated young dwarf who shows up on time and puts in the work.
“Stay true to the Trifecta, procreate, and provide opportunity for your future. In hundred years, a Grolsch will Sing on The Line …"

And Timou sings for the Trifecta…
