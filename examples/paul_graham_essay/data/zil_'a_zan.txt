Zil ‘a Zan

The lights never go out at Zil 'a Zan

Largest and most prestigious university in Soskni, famous throughout all of Kazar. Believes in the marriage of the arts and the ways of the engineer. Its name literally means "art and engineering" in ancient high elven speech.

Only six graduates leave the school every year while eight new students are admitted; those who don't excel forced to endure yet another year of academical hardship. Some poor souls have spent their entire lives trying to pass the final exams.

The carapace of many a Steam Singer is carved by a graduate from Zil 'a Zan.

Current leader: Ezeke Van Klemt, Master painter and Orator (human)
