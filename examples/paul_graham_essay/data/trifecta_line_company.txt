Trifecta Line Company

A government run company established by the Trifecta themselves in the year 14 PT, the Trifecta Line Company manages everything related to the Steam Singers in Kazar.

This includes, but is not limited to, the following:
- Steam Singers
- Lease of contracts for Steam Singer assembly
- Stations on the Line
- Expansion of the Line
- Security on the Line

Following the bloody battle after the founder of the Steam Singers, Gregan Stevey, was murdered in 11 PT, the Trifecta monopolised all production of steam engines. Rich merchants vie for the rights to assemble parts in their factories, though they are at all times monitored by representatives from the militaristic Trifecta Line Company.

While the Trifecta themselves are the formal heads of the organisation, there exists a Ministry of Traffic staffed with their most loyal and experienced engineers who oversee the day to day business on the Line.

One of their chief pursuits is ensuring no rival nation understand the nature of their technology, which in turn has led to Steam Singer design becoming increasingly complex and obtuse - the newest Singers a mass og tangled metal and steel.

An entire regiment of the Northbound Guard is assigned to the Trifecta Line Company, known as Officers of the Line.
