Rex Sanitem

Rex Sanitem is an order of clerics famous for having renounced their gods in favour of science. They are based on an island off the south coast of Kazar, owned by their aging founder Rak von Drek, descendant of one of the most pious and wealthy merchant families.

Most renowned for having found a cure to the Zigzag Sickness which plagued several stations south of the Groves of Yonder in the 30's PT. Their vaccine was heralded as a miracle, their order now on the offical payroll of the Trifecta.

Current leader: Emilia von Drek, daughter of Rak von Drek
