With enough data, matrix multiplications, linear layers, and layer normalization we can perform state-of-the-art-machine-translation. Nonetheless, 2020 was definitely the year of transformers! From natural language now they are into computer vision tasks. How did we go from attention to self-attention? Why does the transformer work so damn well? What are the critical components for its success? Read on and find out! In my opinion, transformers are not so hard to grasp. It\\'s the combination of all the surrounding concepts that may be confusing, including attention. That‚Äôs why we will slowly build around all the fundamental concepts. With Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN‚Äôs) we used to treat sequences sequentially to keep the order of the sentence in place. To satisfy that design, each RNN component (layer) needs the previous (hidden) output. As such, stacked LSTM computations were performed sequentially. Until transformers came out! The fundamental building block of a transformer is self-attention. To begin with, we need to get over sequential processing, recurrency, and LSTM‚Äôs! How? By simply changing the input representation! For a complete book to guide your learning on NLP, take a look at the \"Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing\" book. Use the code aisummer35 to get an exclusive 35% discount from your favorite AI blog :) Representing the input sentence Sets and tokenization The transformer revolution started with a simple question: Why don‚Äôt we feed the entire input sequence? No dependencies between hidden states! That might be cool! As an example the sentence ‚Äúhello, I love you‚Äù:\\n\\nThis processing step is usually called tokenization and it\\'s the first out of three steps before we feed the input in the model.

This supports and goes substantially beyond the emission reductions proposed by national governments under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The approach would play a significant part in bridging the gap between current emission trends and what is necessary to put the world on a path that would limit global temperature increase to 2 ¬∞C above pre-industrial levels. The proposed initiatives build on actions that promise numerous benefits to the organizations and individuals undertaking them, and front-runners are already demonstrating that such benefits are real. These initiatives aim to take these benefits to the mainstream, drastically amplifying their impacts and showing all organizations involved that together they can play a leading role in solving the climate challenge. Many of the initiatives also generate significant 'green growth' benefits, stimulating economic development based on environmentally sound solutions and providing additional motivation to engage. We expect that working together on a grand coalition would serve as a catalyst for action, greatly enhancing the willingness of a range of sub-sovereign and non-state actors to contribute to greenhouse-gas emission reductions.

These rapid changes to the Earth system undermine critical life-support systems 1,9,10 , with significant societal impacts already felt 1,3 , and they could lead to triggering tipping points that irreversibly destabilize the Earth system 7,11,12 . These changes are mostly driven by social and economic systems run on unsustainable resource extraction and consumption. Contributions to Earth system change and the consequences of its impacts vary greatly among social groups and countries. Given these interdependencies between inclusive human development and a stable and resilient Earth system 1,2,3,13 , an assessment of safe and just boundaries is required that accounts for Earth system resilience and human well-being in an integrated framework 4,5 . We propose a set of safe and just Earth system boundaries (ESBs) for climate, the biosphere, fresh water, nutrients and air pollution at global and subglobal scales. These domains were chosen for the following reasons. They span the major components of the Earth system (atmosphere, hydrosphere, geosphere, biosphere and cryosphere) and their interlinked processes (carbon, water and nutrient cycles), the ‚Äòglobal commons‚Äô 14 that underpin the planet‚Äôs life-support systems and, thereby, human well-being on Earth; they have impacts on policy-relevant timescales; they are threatened by human activities; and they could affect Earth system stability and future development globally.
