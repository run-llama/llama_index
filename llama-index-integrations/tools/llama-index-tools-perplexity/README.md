For more details on the Perplexity API and Sonar model, please refer to the official [Perplexity Documentation](https://docs.perplexity.ai/home).

## Getting started:

To use this tool, you will need a Perplexity API key. You can obtain one easily by following the steps outlined [here](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/getting-started). 

## Usage Example

	1.	Create a `.env` file in your project root with your API keys:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
PPLX_API_KEY=your-perplexity-api-key
```


	2.	Use the tool in your code:

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os
from llama_index.tools.perplexity.base import PerplexityToolSpec

# Load environment variables from .env
load_dotenv()

# Initialize the Perplexity tool with the API key from the environment
perplexity_tool = PerplexityToolSpec(api_key=os.getenv("PPLX_API_KEY"))

# Call chat_completion with a custom query and specify the model as "sonar-pro"
response = perplexity_tool.chat_completion("What is going on in the world today?", model="sonar-pro")
print(response)
```
