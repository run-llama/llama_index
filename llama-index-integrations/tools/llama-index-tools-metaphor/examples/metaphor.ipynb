What are these models even made of?!‚Äù</em>, you may be exclaiming to unsuspecting strangers on the streets. </p>\\n<p>Not much it turns out, other than a bunch of attention and feedforward operations. </p>\\n<p>While the individual components that make up the Transformer model are not particularly novel, this is still a pretty dense paper with a lot\\nof moving parts. So our aim in this post will be to distill the model to its key contributions, without getting too stuck\\nin the details.</p>\\n<p>But first, the TLDR for the paper:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li><strong>Transformers demonstrate that recurrence and convolution are not essential for building high-performance natural language models</strong></li>\\n<li><strong>They achieve state-of-the-art machine translation results using a self-attention operation</strong></li>\\n<li><strong>Attention is a highly-efficient operation due to its parallelizability and runtime characteristics</strong></li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>If that sounds exciting, read onward!</p>\\n<h2>How Transformers Work</h2>\\n<p>While the Transformer does not use traditional recurrent units or convolutions, it still takes inspiration from\\nsequence-to-sequence architectures where we encode some input and iteratively decode a desired output. </p>\\n<p>How does this play out in practice? Let‚Äôs focus on the encoder first. There are quite a few elements to the process,\\nso don‚Äôt get too lost in the details. All we are doing is encoding some inputs üôÇ.</p>\\n<p>Assume we start with a certain phrase that we would like to translate from Spanish to English. The Transformer\\nbegins by embedding the tokens of the Spanish phrase into a conventional embedding matrix:</p>\\n<p>\\n <a href=\"/static/input_embedding_matrix-a2e9df88621a1dae9c4c16b097b808ae-1c473.png\">\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n </a>\\n </p>\\n<p>Because the model makes no use of recurrence, we need some way to represent position-based information\\nin the model. Hence we add a positional encoding to this embedding matrix, whose exact form we will describe\\nin the next section:</p>\\n<p>\\n <a href=\"/static/positional_encoding_added-9eb9de50b7ddfe4287ef9e386649e292-d8e49.png\">\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n </a>\\n </p>\\n<p>Our modified input is fed into the first layer of the Transformer encoder. Within each encoder layer,\\nwe perform a series of operations on the inputs.</p>\\n<p>First off, we feed the input through a multi-head attention operation:</p>\\n<p>\\n <a href=\"/static/multihead_attention_encoder-503fd3d322872609873e62cbb1ca98d4-71c2a.png\">\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n </a>\\n </p>\\n<p>To this attention output, we also add a residual connection as well as perform a layer normalization step:</p>\\n<p>\\n <a href=\"/static/residual_layer_to_multihead_attention-8249f2237caed6af900dabf68ef86f39-14', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n')]"
