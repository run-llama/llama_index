Several assertions have\\nalready been made about room temperature superconductivity but were never\\nverified or reproduced across the labs. The cuprates were the earliest high\\ntransition temperature superconductors, and it seems that copper has done the\\nmagic once again. Last week, a Korean group synthesized a Lead Apatite-based\\ncompound LK-99, showing a T$_c$ of above 400$^\\\\circ$K. The signatures of\\nsuperconductivity in the compound are very promising, in terms of resistivity\\n(R = 0) and diamagnetism at T$_c$. Although, the heat capacity (C$_p$) did not\\nshow the obvious transition at T$_c$. Inspired by the interesting claims of\\nabove room temperature superconductivity in LK-99, in this article, we report\\nthe synthesis of polycrystalline samples of LK-99, by following the same heat\\ntreatment as reported in [1,2] by the two-step precursor method. The phase is\\nconfirmed through X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements, performed after each\\nheat treatment. The room temperature diamagnetism is not evidenced by the\\nlevitation of a permanent magnet over the sample or vice versa. Further\\nmeasurements for the confirmation of bulk superconductivity on variously\\nsynthesized samples are underway.
