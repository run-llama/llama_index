    "[AgentQL](https://www.agentql.com/) tools provide web interaction and structured data extraction from any web page using an [AgentQL query](https://docs.agentql.com/agentql-query) or a Natural Language prompt.

    "AgentQL provides three function tools. The first doesn't require a browser and relies on the REST API:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`extract_web_data_with_rest_api`** extracts structured data as JSON from a web page given a URL using either an [AgentQL query](https://docs.agentql.com/agentql-query/query-intro) or a Natural Language description of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other two tools must be used with a `Playwright` browser or a remote browser instance via Chrome DevTools Protocal (CDP):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`extract_web_data_from_browser`** extracts structured data as JSON from the active web page in a browser using either an [AgentQL query](https://docs.agentql.com/agentql-query/query-intro) or a Natural Language description.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`get_web_element_from_browser`** finds a web element on the active web page in a browser using a Natural Language description and returns its CSS selector for further interaction.\n",
