Here's a README for the `Desearch` integration, modeled after the example you provided:

# LlamaIndex Tools Integration: Desearch

This tool connects to Desearch to enable your agent to perform searches across various platforms like web, Twitter, and more.

To begin, you need to obtain an API key from the Desearch developer dashboard.

Website: https://desearch.io

## Usage

Here's an example usage of the `DesearchToolSpec`.

To get started, you will need an [Desearch API key](https://console.desearch.ai/api-keys)

```python
# %pip install llama-index llama-index-core desearch-py

from llama_index_desearch.tools import DesearchToolSpec
from llama_index.agent.openai import OpenAIAgent

desearch_tool = DesearchToolSpec(
    api_key=os.environ["DESEARCH_API_KEY"],
)
agent = OpenAIAgent.from_tools(desearch_tool.to_tool_list())

agent.chat("Can you find the latest news on quantum computing?")
```

### Available Functions

- **ai_search_tool**: Perform a search using Desearch across multiple platforms like web, Twitter, Reddit, etc.
- **twitter_search_tool**: Perform a basic Twitter search using the Desearch API.
- **web_search_tool**: Perform a basic web search using the Desearch API.

This loader is designed to be used as a way to load data as a Tool in an Agent.
