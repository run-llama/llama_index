"""
Simple example demonstrating the CogneeGraphRAG integration.

This script shows how to:
1. Initialize the CogneeGraphRAG
2. Add documents to the knowledge graph
3. Process the data into a graph
4. Search for information
5. Visualize the graph

Requirements:
- Set OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable
- Install the package: pip install llama-index-graph-rag-cognee
