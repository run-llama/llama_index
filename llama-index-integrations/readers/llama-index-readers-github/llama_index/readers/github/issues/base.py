"""
GitHub repository issues reader.

Retrieves the list of issues of a GitHub repository and converts them to documents.

Each issue is converted to a document by doing the following:

    - The text of the document is the concatenation of the title and the body of the issue.
    - The title of the document is the title of the issue.
    - The doc_id of the document is the issue number.
    - The extra_info of the document is a dictionary with the following keys:
        - state: State of the issue.
        - created_at: Date when the issue was created.
        - closed_at: Date when the issue was closed. Only present if the issue is closed.
        - url: URL of the issue.
        - assignee: Login of the user assigned to the issue. Only present if the issue is assigned.
    - The embedding of the document is not set.
    - The doc_hash of the document is not set.
