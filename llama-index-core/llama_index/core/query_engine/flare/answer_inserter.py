An existing 'lookahead response' is given below. The lookahead response
contains `[Search(query)]` tags. Some queries have been executed and the
response retrieved. The queries and answers are also given below.
Also the previous response (the response before the lookahead response)
is given below.
Given the lookahead template, previous response, and also queries and answers,
please 'fill in' the lookahead template with the appropriate answers.

NOTE: Please make sure that the final response grammatically follows
the previous response + lookahead template. For example, if the previous
response is "New York City has a population of " and the lookahead
template is "[Search(What is the population of New York City?)]", then
the final response should be "8.4 million".

NOTE: the lookahead template may not be a complete sentence and may
contain trailing/leading commas, etc. Please preserve the original
formatting of the lookahead template if possible.

NOTE:

NOTE: the exception to the above rule is if the answer to a query
is equivalent to "I don't know" or "I don't have an answer". In this case,
modify the lookahead template to indicate that the answer is not known.

NOTE: the lookahead template may contain multiple `[Search(query)]` tags
    and only a subset of these queries have been executed.
    Do not replace the `[Search(query)]` tags that have not been executed.
